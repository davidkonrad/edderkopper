Forkrop lysebrun til mørkebrun med variable mørkere tegninger. Brystpladen (sternum) mørkebrun med gullig midtstribe. Femora og tibia I er fortykkede, det samme er i mindre grad tilfældet for femora og tibia II. Benfarven veksler mellem gul og mørkebrun, som regel er femora apikalt mørke, patella mørke mens øvrige benled er lysere. Ben mangler torne på nær en enkelt, som er tilstede på femur I. Bagkroppen er kugleformet, højere end lang, og med sølvskinnende pletter adskilt af et mørkt brunligt netmønster. Som regel med noget variable, mørke tegninger i midtlinien, som sommetider kan være reduceret til nogle mindre, mørke tværbjælker i hjertemærke regionen. Hver side af bagkroppen har endvidere nogle lyst til mørkt brune felter. Hanner er mindre kugleformede end hunnerne, med de mørke områder på bagkroppen generelt mere udtalte og med de lyse pletter mindre sølvskinnende. De voksne hanners palper er meget store i forhold til kropsstørrelsen. Arten anlægger et lille hjulspind på ca. 20 cm i diameter, hvor 2-5 radii løber sammen før de mødes i spindets centrum. Edderkoppen sidder i centrum af spindet og holder en tråd, der udgår fra centrum af spindet og hvor den anden ende er fastgjort til nærliggende vegetation. Tråden holdes stramt, således at spindet har kegleform. Når et byttedyr flyver ind i spindet slækkes tråden så spindets fangevne øges. De lysebrune ægkokoner minder i udformningen om piratedderkoppernes (Mimetidae) kokoner, idet de er dråbe- til kugleformede for enden af en lang, hvidlig stilk. Overfladen er dog papiragtig, og ikke kruset som hos piratedderkopperne. De karakteristiske kokoner kan findes fastgjort til vegetationen, gerne højere end fangspindene, og kan afsløre tilstedeværelse af Theridiosoma selv uden fund af dyr.","The anterior medial eyes are surrounded by black pigmentation. Carapace is yellow brown to dark brown with variable darker markings. Sternum is dark brown with yellow midline. Femora and tibia I thickened, femora and tibia II less so. The leg colour varies from yellow to dark brown, usually femora are dark brown apically, and the patella uniformly dark brown while remaining segments are lighter. The legs are spineless, except for one spine on femur I. Abdomen globose, higher than long, dorsal surface with silvery spots isolated by dark brown reticulations. Some silvery spots may have an orange tint. Midline area lacks spots in some places, however the exact pattern is very variable among individual spiders. Usually there are som transverse bars or wedges. Each side of the abdomen usually has dark areas lacking silvery spots. Males are less globose than females and the dark areas of the abdomen are sometimes larger than in the female and the light spots are less silvery. Palps of adult males are quite large compared to the body size. The species constructs small, modified orb webs, of which 2-5 radii converge before gathering at the centre of the web. A single thread is attached to nearby vegetation, and is held by the spider staying in the centre of the web. The thread is drawn tight such as the web is pulled into a conical shape. When prey encounters the web, the thread is slackened to enhance entangling. The females construct small spherical egg sacs with a brownish papery surface. The sacks are attached to the vegetation by long whitish stalks, usually higher up than the web. The egg sacks are very characteristic, and reveal the presence of Theridiosoma even if no specimens are found. Spiders of the Mimetidae construct egg sacks not unlike those of Theridiosoma, however they differ by having a woolly surface.","1.5-2","2-3","Våde, mere eller mindre permanent oversvømmede steder i moser og kær samt søbredder med tæt vegetation.

Despite much collecting activity subsequent to 1912 no further specimens of this species have been found. On the other hand this is a rare species in much of its range so its occurrence in the Faroes cannot be ruled out.

In Iceland also away from the sea (up to 300 m), such as sparsely vegetated lakeshores, in very open grassland, and in hayfields and pastures (Agnarsson 1996) indicating that the species is not an obligate halobiont.

Bagkroppen har to pukler på toppen og er ellers lige så høj som den er lang. Forkroppen er flad og relativ lille. Hele dyret inklusive forbenenes hårduske er meget variabel i farven, som kan spænde fra lyst gul til næsten sort. Den stjerneformede ægkokon vogtes af hunnen. Når et byttedyr skal udsuges, bliver det  indspundet i et nærmest plastikposeagtigt spind. Efterhånden som udsugningen skrider frem bliver "posen" mindre og mindre, for til sidst at blive sluppet af edderkoppen, og falde ned som en lille mørk kugle.","Leg I is very long, about 5 times the length of the carapace. Tibia I is provided with several stout spines but are difficult to discern because of the dense hairing of the legs. Calamistrum on leg IV with about 50 bristles. The long brush of hairs on distal half is on the other hand very conspicuous. The abdomen is provided with two large humps. The species is very variable in colouration. Some specimens are unicoloured in light cream with few golden hairs on carapace and legs. Other specimens are much darker, usually brownish very often mottled in lighter colours. Darker specimens also have the legs annulated with lighter hairs.","3-4","4-6","Arten er vel etableret i gartnerier, blomsterbutikker og i supermarkeders planteafdelinger, hvor den alt efter rengøringens effektivitet kan findes i større eller mindre antal.

Females spend most of their time in well-camouflaged burrows. The burrows are difficult to spot as they are closed with a silken lid camouflaged with natural substrate such as moss, pebbles, and leaf fragments. The burrow is about 25 mm in diameter extending in to the ground, bending after ca. 5 cm (German Wikipedia). The mount of the tube is lined with white silk.","","","","","","","","","Very large wolf spider with velvety appearance. The two sexes differ somewhat in size with males being considerably smaller than females. Also, males are more slender built and the legs are relatively longer than in females. The two sexes are fairly similar in colouration, except for the abdomen appearing overall brown in females while grey in males. Lateral bands of carapace pink to rusty brownish with quite characteristic sinuous blackish edges. Median band pale. Abdomen with clearly dark cardiac mark (except where lightened by whitish pubescence). The cardiac mark spans the length of the two first chevrons. The following chevrons are shorter and reduced to dark transverse markings at rear. Venter black. A very noticeable bright orange area is present around the spinners.

A female was taken at Kirkebö-Reyn on July 27, 1912 (Schenkel, 1925). It was identified as <i>Pardosa eiseni</i> but Schenkel's description of the specimen and the drawing of the epigyne fit <i>Pardosa trailli</i> better (a misidentification by Schenkel was also suspected by Holm (1980)). The two species differ in general appearance (Nentwig et al., 2003). <i>Pardosa eiseni</i> is characterized by having a light longitudinal median band on the carapace and yellow legs. <i>Pardosa trailli</i> on the other has an almost uniform dark carapace with unclear longitudinal bands and dark brown legs. Schenkel writes: "Der stark abgeriebene Körper ist schwarz, die noch vorhandenen Haare rotbraun; an der schwärzlichen Beinen sind die hellen Ringe nur angedeutet". Although the hairs of the carapace apparently were rubbed off Schenkels specimen the leg colouration is in accordance with <i>Pardosa trailli</i>. Also the his illustration of the epigyne points to <i>Pardosa trailli</i>. The septal ridge of the epigyne of <i>Pardosa eiseni</i> is expanded posteriorly with three large swellings while only the two lateral swellings are present in <i>Pardosa trailli</i> (Almquist, 2005). Schenkel's drawing of the epigyne shows only two swellings. However, it should be noted that some authors consider the epigynes of the two species to be identical (Nentwig et al., 2003). <i>Pardosa trailli</i> occurs in Scotland about 350 km from the Faroes while the nearest populations of <i>Pardosa eiseni</i> are found farther away in Norway about 600 km from the Faroes. None of the species are known from Iceland. Thus it is more probable that <i>Pardosa trailli</i> have colonised the Faroes or that stray specimens could reach the islands. Thus, in weighing the above evidence I find <i>Pardosa trailli</i> much more likely than <i>Pardosa eiseni</i> and in contrast to earlier checklists for the Faroes I have here removed <i>Pardosa eiseni</i> in favour of <i>Pardosa trailli</i>.","","","","","Male and female are similar in colouration (Almquist 2005).
