The male carapace in most European species is elevated, often into large lobes or modified in some other way. However, in a few species such as in <i>W. dysderoides</i> the male head is only slightly domed behind the eyes. Where there is a lobe this carries the posterior median eyes (Millidge 1983). In other species the male carapaces carries a projection, often furnished with hairs which may be clavate or furcated. More rarely is the carapace of the female elevated, such as in <i>W. acuminata</i> which carries a conical elevation. The sternum is longer than wide with the posterior end pointed between coxae IV (Locket & Millidge 1953). The <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Walckenaeria_atrotibialis_male_JL5576_19806.JPG">pedicel </a>is distinctly sclerotized and is quite conspicuous in some species. The abdomen is without a scutum and is unicoloured in most species, usually greyish black but occasionally light grey or yellowish brown. Tibia I and II carries two spines while III and IV carries one in the European species. Legs are unicoloured in most species, often bright orange or reddish orange. Some species have contrastingly blackened tibiae on anterior leg pairs. Spines are weak, particularly on legs I and II in males (Millidge 1983). All metatarsi with a trichobothrium, Tm I variable, ranging from 0.39-0.76 in British species (Roberts 1987). The male palpal organs are of similar form and differences are not discernible with a hand lens. Females of a few species possess characteristic epigynes which makes them identifiable in the field using a hand lens. Other characteristics of the genus (not visible with a lens) include the strongly pectinate and large superior tarsal claws of legs I and II, clear transverse striae on the lateral faces of the chelicerae and the acuminate tarsus of the female palp (Locket & Millidge 1953, Millidge 1983). The European members of the genus have been reviewed by Wunderlich (1972) and the North American by Millidge (1983). ","","","","","","There are five, possibly six Faroese species (the single record of <i>Walckenaeria obtusa</i> from 1912 is possibly a misidentified <i>W. nudipalpis</i> female, the habitus and epigynes of the two species being very similar). The species are characterized by sleek, fairly elongate blackish bodies and often bright orange or reddish orange legs (tibia I and II blackened in <i>W. antica</i>). All Faroese species have the head elevated in males. Two species have their heads slightly raised into a conical elevation carrying the eyes (<i>W. obtusa</i> and <i>W. nudipalpis</i>). Two other species have their carapaces modified by possessing a small protuberance, upward directed in <i>W. clavicornis</i> and forward directed in <i>W. cuspidata</i>). Males of the two last species have their heads modified into distinctly different lobes, a single large lobe in the small <i>W. nodosa</i> and two lobes in the slightly larger <i>W. antica</i>, the anterior smaller lobe carrying a pair of horns. All Faroese males (except <i>W. obtusa</i> and <i>W. nudipalpis</i>) are identifiable in the field with a hand lens (18-20x) by observing the carapaces in lateral view. None of the Faroese species have the head elevated in females, and identification in most cases requires a stereomicroscope although size differences narrow the possibilities.

Bagkroppen er forsynet med 1-2 par pukler. På bagkroppens overside ses krumme, børstelignende hår. De forreste midterøjne er let fremspringende. Afstanden mellem de forreste midterøjne og hovedets forkant (højden af clypeus) er ca. den samme som afstanden mellem de forreste og bagerste midterøjne. Længden af ben I er under 1⅓ af længden af ben IV. De to almindeligste danske arter, <i>E. furcata</i> og <i>E. cambridgei</i> overlapper i habitat, og er vanskelige at adskille alene på udseendet. Arterne har lys gulbrun forkrop med noget variable sorte bånd langs siderne, som ofte når helt ud til kanten. I midtlinien, især ved øjenregionen, ses flere uregelmæssige og variable sorte tegninger. Da forkropstegningerne er ret ens for arterne men er noget variable kan de ikke anvendes til at adskille arterne. <i>Ero</i> arterne spinder nogle meget karakteristiske gulbrune ægsække, som består af en ægformet eller aflang sæk, som er ca. 4 mm i diameter, og omviklet med krusede tråde af lidt mørkere farve. Sækken hænger i en 1-2 cm lang stilk som typisk er fastgjort til vegetation, herunder grene og bark på træer. Ægsækkene vogtes ikke, men forlades af hunnen som opsøger nye byttedyr for at kunne producere flere ægsække. Da arterne er nataktive, og gemmer sig væk i dagtimerne, er ægsækkene ofte et tydeligt vidnesbyrd om deres tilstedeværelse.","The species of this genus resemble comb-footed spiders (Theridiidae) due to their globular abdomen, which is higher than long. The abdomen bears one or two pairs of conical tubercles. The dorsal parts of the abdomen are furnished with curved bristle-like hairs. The anterior medial eyes projects on a small tubercle. The distance between the anterior edge of the carapace and the anterior medial eyes (height of clypeus) is about the same as the distance between the anterior and posterior medial eyes. The length of leg I is slightly less than 1⅓ times that of leg IV. The two commonest Danish species of the genus, <i>E. furcata</i> and <i>E. cambridgei</i>, are difficult to separate as they overlap both in general appearance and habitat. The carapaces of the species are light yellowish brown with variable blackish lateral bands, which often reach the margins. I the midline and especially the eye region there are additional irregular blackish markings. Since these markings on the carapace are quite similar for the species, they are not useful for separating the species. The egg sacks of <i>Ero</i> are very characteristic. The more or less egg-shaped sack is about 4 mm in diameter, and made of yellowish brown silk which is surrounded by loosely woven silk of a darker colour giving the sack a woolly appearance. The sack is suspended by a cord of silk about 1-2 cm long, typically fastened to vegetation, including branches and bark of trees. The sacks are not guarded but abandoned by the female, which set out for more prey to be able to produce more egg sacks. Since <i>Ero</i> species are nocturnal, and remain hidden during the daytime, the egg sacks often reveal the presence of the species before specimens are found.","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eyes are variable in size, in some species minute or absent. Metatarsus IV without a trichobothrium. The species differ in leg spination, a character that is useful for grouping the species aiding identification. Male palp with no tibial apophysis. Some species possess stridulating files on coxa I while these are reduced or absent in others. The latter case is considered a derived (apomorphic) character of the genus. Tm I of British species range between 0.3-0.64 (Roberts 1987).","","A fairly homogenous group of small spiders which are difficult to identify due to similarity of species and rather great intraspecific variation. Some species are adapted morphologically to troglodytic or subterranean lifestyle, e.g. with eyes distinctly reduced or with paler pigmentation. Depending on habitat, troglodytic species exhibit a great degree of plasticity in morphological adaptations (even leg spination varies) which further complicates identification. The species of Porrhomma are mainly found in the temperate zone of the northern Hemisphere, with most species in the Palaearctic region.

The Faroese species differ in leg spination (Roberts 1987), size of eyes (Locket & Millidge 1953) and to some extent also position of Tm I (Roberts 1987) but unfortunately these characters are not always reliable.

To arter forekommer i Sydeuropa og yderligere én art findes på de Kanariske Øer. Arterne i <i>Uroctea</i> har ikke cribellum, ikke desto mindre er deres fangspind meget lig fangspindet hos <i>Oecobius</i>. Det flade teltlignende spind er ca. 4 cm i diameter og har seks åbninger som giver teltet stjerneform. Fangspindene anlægges på undersiden af sten og edderkoppen sidder med oversiden nedad inde i teltet der således tjener som retræte. Fra hver åbning udgår to signaltråde til omgivelserne. Trådene videregiver vibrationer fra byttedyr som på deres færden berører trådene. Hvis edderkoppen er sulten vil den fare ud og spinde byttedyret ind i silke.  <i>Uroctea</i> har for vane at placere byttedyrsresterne på teltets overside (=spindets underside). Måske tyngdekraftens indvirkning på byttedyrsresterne hjælper med at holde teltet udspændt så edderkoppen lettere kan passere åbningerne. Det er ogå muligt at byttedyrsresterne tjener til at  kamouflere spindet.","The species of <i>Uroctea</i> are found in Eurasia and Africa. Two species occur in southern Europe and one more is known from the Canary Islands. <i>Uroctea</i> species do not have a cribellum, but their web is very similar to the ones built by spiders of the cribellate <i>Oecobius</i> genus. The flat tent-like web is about 4 cm in diameter with six openings giving the tent a star-shaped appearance. The webs are built on the lower surface of stones and the spider sits upside down inside the tent thus serving as a retreat. From every opening two threads radiate to the surrounding, signalling vibrations of prey touching the threads. If hungry, the spider rushes out of the opening nearest to the prey and then tries to wrap they prey with silk. <i>Uroctea</i> has a habit of arranging the remains of the prey onto the lower part of the tent on the outer surface. Perhaps the force of gravity on the prey remains aids to give the tent a domed shape making the openings easier to pass through. The prey remains may alseo serve to camouflage the web.","","","","","","","","","","",""
