4,"Amaurobiidae","Thorell, 1870","Huskartespindere","Hackledmesh Weavers",,"This is a fairly small, poorly defined family, which is represented with ca. 680 species in 71 genera. They are found in most parts of the world with the exception of some arctic areas and islands such as Greenland and the Azorean Islands. Small to large spiders ranging 3-16 mm body size (Jocqué & Dippenaar-Schoeman 2007). Most European species are fairly large and robust, with relatively short and stout legs. Many species are ground dwellers constructing small funnel or tubular webs of cribellate or ecribellate silk under objects on the ground sometimes with a collar of silk spun around the opening. Some members of the <i>Amaurobius</i> genus constructs bluish cribellate webs behind bark of trees or on buildings and fences.","Ret store, kompakte edderkopper.","Most amaurobiids are cribellate but some genera transferred to Amaurobiidae from other families are ecribellate, e.g. <i>Coelotes</i> as well as other genera of the Coelotinae subfamily. Amaurobiids possess three tarsal claws and are entelegyne. The 8 eyes are usually pale and arranged in 2 rows of 4. The carapace is longer than wide, often having a broad, only slightly elevated head region. A fairly distinct, longitudinal fovea is present in many species. The sternum is oval to shield-shaped and blunt apex at rear. The lateral edges of the sternum are often sinuous. The chelicerae are often strong and usually longer and more slender in males than in females. The labium is formed like a rounded square or rectangle. The endites are almost parallel with brushes of hairs (scopulae) anteriorly. The abdomen is usually dominated by shades of brown or grey, often very dark and with markings as more or less distinct chevrons. It is densely covered by fine hairs of varying size. The legs are moderately long, especially in males and mostly uniformly coloured but sometimes with dark annulations. The tarsi and metatarsi are furnished with trichobothria arranged in rows, females with calamistrum on metatarsus IV having two rows of bristles. A more or less strongly divided cribellum is present anterior to the spinners. The cribellum is, however, reduced in males. The epigyne is often formed as a central plate separated from lateral parts by sutures. The male palp has simple sclerotized tibial apophyses and the shapes of these are important for species identification."
6,"Dictynidae","O. P.-Cambridge, 1871","Plantekrustrådspindere","Meshweb Weavers",,"The Dictynidae is relatively species rich encompassing 563 species in 48 genera. The highest diversity is found in the temperate regions. They range in size from very small to medium (1.3-8.0 mm body size). The family is grouped into three rather different subfamilies: Dictyninae, Cicurininae, and Tricholathysinae. Dictynids are cribellate but cribellum is reduced in the Cicurininae. The lifestyle is quite different among the subfamilies. The Dictyninae, encompassing such genera as <i>Dictyna</i>, <i>Emblyna</i> and <i>Nigma</i> are mostly plant dwellers and are found in low vegetation as well as higher up such as shoot apices of grass and bushes or the foliage of trees. Here they build irregular, woolly mesh webs often made of bluish cribellate silk. The Cicurininae (e.g. <i>Cicurina</i> and <i>Lathys</i>) and Tricholathysinae (e.g. <i>Argenna</i> and <i>Altella</i>) are mostly ground-dwellers building their webs underneath logs, stones, and other objects on the ground. They are found in a variety of habitats. Members of the Tricholathysinae are also found in salt marshes and in algal upwash.","Kaldes også plante-kartespindere på dansk, hvilket ikke er helt dækkende, særligt efter at familien har fået tilføjet slægterne <i>Cicurina</i> og <i>Mastigusa</i>, der tidligere var placeret i tragtspinder familien (Agelenidae). Sidstnævnte slægt er knyttet til myretuers indre, og individer træffes kun sjældent i den omkringliggende førn. Bortset fra disse to slægter indeholder familien små cribellate edderkopper, som anlægger små, uregelmæssige krustråsspind i toppen af urter og buske, i førn, under sten og på træstammer. Spindet er ikke klæbrigt som hos de fleste andre edderkopper, men består af mange krøllede tråde, som fastholder byttedyr ved hjælp af velcro virkning.","The dictynids are characterized by having 3 tarsal claws. They are cribellate but in many species the cribellum is reduced. They possess 8 eyes, however there are some 6-eyed <i>Cicurina</i> species in which the anterior medials are reduced. Some blind, cave dwelling <i>Cicurina</i> species even have they eyes reduced to zero. The calamistrum if present is arranged in one row (uniseriate). The cribellum is usually wide in those species possessing cribellum, bipartite or entire (absent in Cicurininae). The cephalic region of the Dictyninae is usually high perhaps to fit the relatively large poison glands. In this subfamily the cephalic region is furnished with longitudinal rows of white hairs. These are not present in the Tricholathysinae in which the carapace is pear-shaped. The sternum is triangular. The chelicerae are long and modified in males of some genera, e.g. <i>Dictyna</i>. The males of this genera has the chelicerae concave in front and bowed outward near the middle, often having a well developed mastidion (denticle or tubercle) on the anterior face of the chelicerae. The endites are converging. Legs are moderately long and usually without spines. In some genera tarsus of each leg are without a trichobothrium (e.g. <i>Dictyna</i>) while tarsus of each leg has one trichobothrium in others (e.g. <i>Lathys</i>). In <i>Cicurina</i>, tarsus of each leg possesses a series of trichobothria, which increase in length towards the distal end as in some genera of the Agelenidae family. In yet other dictynid genera there are two tarsal series of trichobothria. The abdomen is oval to elongate, often overhanging the carapace and densely covered with fine hairs, which sometimes are distributed to form a pattern. The cardiac mark is clear in some genera as in <i>Dictyna</i> but indistinct or absent in others as in <i>Cicurina</i>. Dictynids are entelegyne with the epigyne weakly sclerotized in some genera (e.g. <i>Dictyna</i> and <i>Argenna</i>) while more sclerotized in other genera (e.g. <i>Cicurina</i>). The male palp has a tibial apophysis. The embolus is long and slender in most species."
8,"Uloboridae","Thorell, 1869","Hjulkrustrådsspindere","Cribellate Orb Weavers","Familen indeholder i europa tre artsfattige slægter af særprægede edderkopper, som spinder fangnet af hjulspindtypen, eller fangnet der kan afledes deraf. Dermed benytter de samme konstruktion af fangnettet som de fjerntbeslægtede hjulspindere (korsedderkopper m fl.). Der er dog en stor forskel, idet trådene i fangspiralen hos hjulkrustrådspindere er af cribellat typen (krusspind) som ikke klistrer, men fastholder byttedyr ved hjælp af  velcro virkning. I modsætning hertil afsætter hjulspinderne limdråber på fangspiralen. Hjulkrustrådspindere er også særprægede ved ikke at benytte gift til immobilisering af byttedyrene. I stedet spindes byttet forsigtigt ind i et meget tæt spind, så det ikke længere udgør en fare for edderkoppen. Først da udsuges byttet.","This is a fairly small family, which is represented by ca. 263 species placed in 18 genera and 4 subfamilies. They range in size from small to medium (3-10 mm body size). They spin complete orb webs or sections of orbs similar to the Araneidae and related families. The plane of the web is often more or less horizontal. The spiral threads are made up of cribellate silk rather than silk with glue droplets as in the Araneidae. Uloborids are also unique among spiders in lacking poison glands. Once a prey is tangled in the web it is very carefully covered with silk and feeding begins only when the prey is fully immobilised.",,"The uloborids are entelegyne, cribellate spiders having four or eight eyes and three tarsal claws. They eyes are arranged in two rows of four in the subfamilies Hyptiotinae and Uloborinae. In Miagrammopinae the anterior row is reduced leaving just one row of four. The fourth subfamily, Tangaroinae, has mixed arrangement of the eyes since this subfamily is defined by other characters than carapace morphology. The eyes of <i>Hyptiotes</i> are very peculiar since they are placed rather far back on the carapace. The posterior row is situated about midway on the carapace and the laterals are placed on tubercles. The anterior row is also well removed from the front of the head. Uloborids are also characterized by a dorsally compressed, curved metatarsus IV possessing a uniseriate calamistrum (often absent in males). Additionally diagnostic characters include rows of long trichobothria on femora and the absence of poison glands. The carapace form is very different among the subfamilies and varies from long and narrow (Miagrammopinae) to ovoid (Uloborinae) and triangular (Hyptiotinae). The carapace is clothed with plumose hairs except in the Uloborinae. The sternum is divided in Miagrammopinae but undivided in other subfamilies. The shape is variable, some long, some oval, and some roughly triangular. The chelicerae do not possess a lateral condyle or poison glands. The fang furrows are provided with a cluster of small teeth or with fewer larger teeth. The shape of the labium is also very different among the subfamilies. In Hyptiotinae and Uloborinae it is semicircular but longer in Miagrammopinae. Many species have legs I and IV the longest with legs II only slightly shorter than legs IV. In Uloborinae tibia I is provided with a brush of long hairs. The female palp is provided with a dentate claw. The abdomen may have one or more pairs of humps (four pairs in <i>Hyptiotes cavatus</i>). Usually the colours and body shape provide excellent camouflage but there are some exceptions, for example <i>Uloborus walckenaerius</i> is easily spotted in the field. The anal tubercle is large and two-segmented. The anterior spinners are three-segmented. An undivided cribellum is present in front of the spinners with the exception of some males. The tracheal spiracle is situated in front of the cribellum. The epigyne is with paired projections (e.g. <i>Uloborus</i>) or unpaired (e.g. <i>Hyptiotes</i>). The male palp is complicated sometimes relatively large compared to the size of the spider. The palpal femur has a small tubercle in many species."

De to førstnævnte slægter kan adskilles på farven af bagkroppens underside, som er lys hos de to <i>Pholcus</i> arter, men sort hos <i>Holocnemus pluchei</i>.","The Pholcidae is the ninth largest spider family of the world encompassing ca 969 species and 81 genera. They range in size from very small to medium-sized (1-10 mm body size), usually with long legs that may exceed 60 mm in some species. The species occupy a wide range of habitats and are found all over the world except for some islands and arctic regions. In recent decades synanthropic species in particular have gradually increased their range in the cooler, temperate regions. <i>Pholcus phalangioides</i> serves as an example and is now almost cosmopolitan in distribution. This species inhabit houses in most parts of the world and since it is independent of the climate outdoors it will probably continue to increase its range given there are heated buildings to occupy and enough prey to feed on during the cold season. Other synanthropic species that have increased their range in Europe include <i>Crossopriza lyoni </i> and <i>Holocnemus pluchei</i>. Perhaps global warming has influenced the spread, which mainly have taken place in recent years. Also the species <i>Pholcus opilionoides</i> occurring in natural and semi-natural habitats has increased its range northwards in Europe. Pholcids build three-dimensional messy, irregular, tangled webs in which they hang inverted on the under surface of the web. The webs are often constructed in dark and damp niches such as buildings and cellars, in caves, behind loose bark, in cavities between boulders, under rocks and other objects on the ground and in burrows. The web has no viscid properties but the criss-cross structure delay the escape of insects entangled in the web. The spider quickly advance to wrap its prey in silk and when securely wrapped the spider is able to inflict the fatal bite without any risk. Some species feed on other spiders even of their own kin. In my house I have observed <i>Pholcus phalangioides</i> to prey on spiders of its own species and large, stout species such as <i>Amaurobius similis</i> and <i>Scotophaeus blackwalli</i>. The species is also known to prey on other common house spiders of the northern temperate regions such as species of <i>Tegenaria</i>. I once interrupted the capture of a <i>Salticus scenius</i> female before the fatal bite. The salticid was completely wrapped in silk but nevertheless able to bite its way out and escape still going strong. If food is scarce some pholcids will leave their web and invade the webs of other spiders with the purpose of eating the host, the eggs, or the prey. They vibrate the web to mimic the struggle of trapped prey as an attempt to lure the host of the web to approach, unaware of it will be attacked. This is very much similar to the technique used by the pirate spiders (Mimetidae). When a pholcid is threatened the spider will spin itself in small circles so rapidly that the contours of the spider becomes blurred or almost invisible. This behaviour is possibly an effort to minimize the chance of it falling prey to predators passing by. If the spider continues to feel threatened it may drop from the web and walk away in an unsteady, wobbling fashion. Despite the clumsy pace it is nevertheless able to climb vertical surfaces. After the mating the female sits inverted in her web <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Crossopriza_lyoni_hun_1326.jpg\">carrying her eggs in her chelicerae</a>. The eggs are loosely held together by a few strands of silk. The male will often <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Crossopriza_lyoni_han_og_hun_1527.jpg\">stay nearby the female</a> until he dies. Females often live for more years than males and may mate again with another male. After hatching the spiderlings are either carried by the female for a few days where after <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pholcus_phalangioides_hun_med_unger_569.jpg\">they stay in the web</a> guarded by the female. Eventually they will disperse to start a life on their own. The three northern European genera are easily separated by the shape and colour of their abdomens which is long and tubular in <i>Pholcus</i> and <i>Holocnemus</i> but globular in <i>Psilochorus</i>. The two former genera are distinguished by the colour of the ventral side of their abdomens which is light in the two <i>Pholcus</i> species, but black in <i>Holocnemus pluchei</i>.","De forreste mediære øjne er de mindste, og de øvrige seks er placeret i to triader på en tilnærmelsesvis rund forkrop. Benene er meget lange og tynde med tarsi noget bøjelige.","The pholcids belong to the group of araneomorph, ecribellate spider families having 6 or 8 eyes and 3 tarsal claws. The anterior medials are smallest or absent in six-eyed species. The secondary eyes are arranged in two <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pholcus_phalangioides_han_JL4381_D3400.JPG\">triads</a>, which in some species are placed on tubercles. Other diagnostic characters for the family include the high, often concave <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pholcus_phalangioides_hun_1280.jpg\">clypeus</a> of about the same height as the chelicerae and the usually very long <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pholcus_opilionoides_female_JL4834_7509.JPG\">legs</a> with long and flexible tarsi with many pseudosegments. The carapace is <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pholcus_phalangioides_hun_1282.jpg\">subcircular</a> with the head region often raised. In some species fovea is well developed. The <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pholcus_phalangioides_han_JL4381_D3404.JPG\">sternum</a> is convex often with sinuous sides, broadly truncated at rear. The chelicers are relatively weak and fused along the greater part of length. Males often have the chelicerae armed with teeth-like outgrowths. The labium is wider than long and fused with sternum. The female palp is small, slender and is not provided with a claw or tooth. The shape of the abdomen varies from globose to elongated cylindrical. The most common colours of the abdomen range between pale grey and darker brownish-grey. <i>Psilochorus simoni</i> has a bluish-green or blue abdomen. In some species a <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pholcus_phalangioides_hun_JL4381_D3344.JPG\">cardiac mark</a> is clearly visible while in others this mark is just faintly darker than the ground colour of the abdomen. Many species also possess darker chevrons, bandings or blotches mainly in the midline of the abdomen. The abdomen of <i>Holocnemus pluchei</i> is <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Holocnemis_pluchei_juv_1539.jpg\">reticulated</a> very much like a giraffe. In some genera the <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Psilochorus_simoni_juv_JL4361_3622.jpg\">spinners</a> are situated ventrally and moved forward to a position near the epigastric furrow. There is no tracheal spiracle. Despite being haplogyne, pholcids do have the internal female genitalia protected by an epigyne like sclerotization. These are rather variable and allow pholcids to be identified from drawings of epigynes with the same ease as entelegyne spiders. The <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pholcus_phalangioides_han_1274.jpg\">male palp</a> is very complex having swollen palp segments and a large paracymbium."

15,"Gnaphosidae","Pocock, 1898","Museedderkopper","Ground Spiders",,"The Gnaphosidae is the seventh largest spider family of the world encompassing ca. 2000 species in 8 subfamilies and 114 genera. They range in size from small to large (2-18 mm body size). The species are free-living found mailnly at ground level in open habitats but some species are house spiders, for example <i>Scotophaeus blackwalli</i> in the northern parts of its distributional range. They build a tubular retreat, from which they leave at night to hunt prey. The female guard her papery egg sack hidden in small holes under logs, stones, etc. Most species are active at night, however spiders of the somewhat atypical genus <i>Micaria</i> are diurnal hunters running rapidly about in bright sunshine.","Robuste edderkopper i sorte og brune farver. Nogle arter har et karakteristisk bagkropsmønster, typisk hvide pletter på mørk baggrund, eller lyse prikker eller linier. Hos nogle arter ses metalglans. Bagkroppen er noget fladtrykt og langstrakt. Hos nogle arters hanner ses et scutum forrest på bagkroppen. Det danske navn \"Museedderkopper\" refererer til bagkroppens tætte fløjlsbehåring, der leder tanken hen på musepels. Hovedet er ikke skarpt afsat fra thorax. De bagerste midterøjne er ofte ikke runde men ovale, trekantede eller sprækkeformede. De forreste spindevorter  er rørformede, længere end de bagerste og placeret ret langt fra hinanden. Tarsi med to kløer og en tæt børste af hår. På tarsi ses også scopulae som er en tæt rækkestillet børste af korte hår. Arterne er primært knyttet til jordoverfladen, men for eksempel er  arter i <i>Scotophaeus</i> slægten husedderkopper.  De fleste arter er nataktive. De spinder en rørformet retræte som udgangspunkt for opsøgende jagt på byttedyr.","The gnaphosids are rather stout ecribellate spiders with a flattened and elongate abdomen. The carapace is ovoid and rather low being smoothly convex and with a distinct fovea in most species. The head is not sharply set off from the thoracic region. Gnaphosids are fairly easily recognized by their cylindrical and parallel spinners, the anterior pair being slightly longer, and more heavily sclerotized than the posterior pair. The anterior spinners are separated from each other by approximately one spinner diameter with some exceptions, e.g. <i>Micaria</i> in which genus anterior spinners are closer. They have 8 eyes in 2 rows. The posterior medial eyes are often not round, but oval, triangular or reduced to slits. All eyes are with a silvery sheen except for the anterior medials, which are dark. The sternum is ovoid, pointed posteriorly. The chelicerae are robust, and the fang furrows are provided with teeth. The retromargin may have a sclerotized lamina (flat, keel-like plate) in place of teeth. This lamina is serrated in some genera. The curvature of the posterior row of eyes and the position and shape of cheliceral lamina and teeth are important characters when keying gnaphosids to genus level under the stereomicroscope. The endites usually have an oblique or transverse depression. They are provided with a serrula (row or cluster of tiny teeth on the front margin). Gnaphosids are also characterized by having 2 tarsal claws, claw tufts, and scopulae. Legs are stout and in some species there are small brushes of more and less stiff hairs present distally on metatarsus IV. Female palp is furnished with small spines and a finely toothed claw. The abdomen is often provided with dense coverage of short sleek hairs giving the abdomen a mousy-like appearance. Sometimes erect, curved setae are present, particularly at the anterior edge (see for example images of <i>Gnaphosa lucifuga</i>). Many species are uniformly coloured in greyish-brown or blackish colours. However, abdomens of some species have striking white patterns of spots or lines while abdomens of others are iridescent. Most males have a scutum at the anterior end. The spiracle is situated close to the spinners. Gnaphosids are entelegyne spiders often having rather large epigynes with sclerotized structures. They are somewhat variable and closely related species may be difficult to identify. Male palps are usually provided with a large tibial apophysis and the shape of this is important when identifying the species."
16,"Clubionidae","Wagner, 1887","Sækspindere","Foliage Spiders","Lever en forholdvis skjult tilværelse, typisk på vegetation, om dagen skjult i retræter på blade, mellem visne blade i tuer, bag bark og under objekter på jorden.","The Clubionidae is relatively species rich encompassing 537 species in 14 genera. They range in size from small to medium (2,5-12 mm body size). The species are found at ground level in open habitats but many species inhabit foliage, branches, and stems of trees. Clubionids spend the daytime in saclike retreats with or without openings. The retreats are placed in folded or rolled up leaves, behind loose bark, under stones or under other objects on the ground. Clubionids leave their retreats during the night to hunt prey as active free-living hunters using no web or snares. They are swift runners having good footing to slippery surfaces due to the adhesive properties of the claw tufts. They take their prey by moving upon it and seizing it with the strong and toothed chelicerae. The female spins a silken sac in which she guards her egg sack. These sacs are larger than retreats and if placed in foliage they are often constructed by bending the leaves together to form a cavity, which is then spun together and sealed with plenty of whitish silk.","Arterne i familien har en overfladisk lighed med nogle af arterne i Gnaphosidae, men de mangler de cylindriske spindevorter, og har de bagerste midterøjne cirkulære.

The species superficially resemble members of the Gnaphosidae, but the anterior spinners of the clubionids are conical and the posterior median eyes are circular. The sexes are quite similar with the males slightly smaller and often with more elongate and slender chelicers as well as longer legs. The eyes are uniform in size, arranged close to the anterior edge of the carapace in two fairly wide rows each with four eyes. The posterior row is slightly wider than the anterior. The carapace is ovoid, clearly longer than wide and with short, shallow fovea. However, in some species fovea is absent. The sternum is distinctly margined in some species. The chelicers are rather long and stout and the fang furrows are provided with teeth both pro- and retromarginally. Some males have strongly developed chelicerae with a long fang. Also, in many species the chelicers are conspicuously dark. Endites are longer than wide and without the depression seen in gnaphosids. The endites are furnished with a brush of setae (scopulae) on distal end to improve grip of prey. The labium is longer than wide. The body is carried close to the substratum on moderately long, strong legs with normal prograde orientation. The legs are provided with two tarsal claws with dense claw tufts and scopulae giving good adhesion to slippery surfaces such as leaves. The tibia and metatarsi have one, two, or more pairs of spines ventrally. Some species have legs I the longest while other species legs IV. The abdomen is oval often tapering towards the spinners. Males sometimes have a small scutum. The abdomen usually uniformly coloured except for darker cardiac mark. Sometimes there are darker markings such as a median line or chevrons in the same colours as the cardiac mark. The anterior spinners of the clubionids are conical and contiguous and all three pairs form a compact cluster. The spiracle is situated close to the spinners. Clubionids are entelegyne spiders having the genital groove with its openings to the internal genitalia covered by a well-sclerotized plate (epigastric scutum), which also bears the paired copulatory openings. The spermathecae are often visible through the integument. The male palp has a retrolateral tibial apophysis. The shape of the apophysis varies greatly between species and is an important morphological character when identifying the species under the stereomicroscope."

Nogle arter kan skifte farve efter omgivelserne. De spinder ikke fangnet og retræter, ej heller til hudskifte eller overvintring.","The Thomisidae is the sixth largest spider family of the world encompassing ca 2062 species in 7 subfamilies and 171 genera.
They range in size from small to large (2-23 mm body size). Thomisids have sturdy, moderately depressed bodies and strong, laterigrade legs with legs I and II longer than III and IV in most subfamilies. They move around in a characteristic crab-like fashion being capable of walking sideways as well as forwards and backwards. There is a great diversity in colours and forms. Some more brightly coloured species are active during the day. They occupy blossoms or other parts of vegetation where they ambush prey, often pollinators much larger than themselves. Some species are even capable of changing colour over a period of hours to several days to match the colour of the flower petals in which they reside. Other ground and bark living species have markings in grey and brown giving excellent camouflage in these surroundings. Some <i>Ozyptila</i> species are <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Ozyptila_scabricula_subfemale_JL5014_7355.JPG\">covered by dirt</a> making them very difficult to spot on the ground. They make no prey-catching webs and spin no retreats for moulting, oviposition, or wintering. The first two pairs of legs are used for grabbing the prey when it inattentively have become within grasp. Legs III and IV are provided with scopulae and help to anchor the spider to the substrate during the short struggle with the prey. Once bitten the prey dies within seconds due to the high potency of thomisid venom. Often there is a great disparity in size and colouration between males and females, the males usually being much smaller and darker than the females. The courtship involves the male touching the female in a way that makes her adopt a submissive posture. Females are frequently seen <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Xysticus_ulmi_female_JL4980_9164.JPG\">guarding their eggsack</a>.","Medlemmerne af denne famile har en meget karakteristisk kropsbygning. Forkrop og bagkrop er brede og affladigede. Det første og andet benpar er tydeligt længere og kraftigere end de to bagerste, og benstillingen er laterigrad, dvs. drejet fremad så leddene bøjer i plan med kroppen. Bevægelserne er langsomme, og ofte sidelæns, hvilket giver en krabbelignende gangart. De fleste arter har to laterale bånd på forkroppen, som undertiden når helt ud til kanten. De midterste øjne er de mindste, de laterale sidder på små udvækster (tubercler), og de bagerste laterale vender i en retning skråt bagud. Bagkroppen er typisk bredest bagtil. Chelicererne er små, tilpasset til hurtig aflivning af byttedyr ved bid i hoved eller nakke.","The thomisids belong to the group of araneomorph, ecribellate spider families having 8 eyes and 2 tarsal claws. <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Xysticus_kochi_male_JL4730_5479.JPG\">The eyes</a> are arranged in two recurved rows of four with the posterior row usually more curved than the anterior row. The median eyes are the smallest, the laterals on confluent tubercles, with the posterior laterals facing somewhat backwards. The secondary eyes are provided with tapetum. Thomisids belong to a morphologically very diverse family of spiders generally characterized by broad, moderately flattened carapace and abdomen. The carapace is about as long as wide being semicircular, ovoid or slightly elongated sometimes with protuberances. Usually, it is thinly covered by a few erect simple or clavate setae sometimes arising from warts. Most species have lateral bands on the carapace; sometimes the bands reach the edge. The sternum is heart-shaped. Chelicerae are relatively small and weak, adapted for quick kills by biting prey in the head. Cheliceral teeth are absent except in one subfamily. Sometimes there are small teeth (denticles) present on promargin. Endites and labium are frequently longer than wide. Legs I and II are longer and sturdier than legs III and IV. Legs articulate in plane of the body (laterigrade legs). The anterior legs are often provided with series of strong spines on tibia and metatarsi (e.g. <i>Xysticus</i> and <i>Ozyptila</i>). The abdomen is variable in shape and colour. It may be round, ovoid or elongate, nearly always widest at rear half. It is often covered by scattered <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Heriaeus_graminicola_female_JL4920_7857.JPG \">simple setae</a> or <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Ozyptila_scabricula_female_JL5014_10353.JPG\">clavate hairs</a>. Abdominal colours vary from bright hues of white, yellow, green, and pink to shades of grey and brown in obscure patterns. The anterior spinners are short and conical and situated close together. A colulus is present in front of the spinners. The tracheal spiracle is situated close to the spinners. The epigyne is small and weakly sclerotized in some species. The epigynes of <i>Xysticus</i> species can be highly variable in depth of sclerotization within the same species and females are therefore sometimes difficult to identify by examination of epigynes. The tibia of the male palp is provided with ventral and retrolateral apophyses. Embolus is often long and curved along the rim of the cymbium."

Ungerne fragtes så med rundt af hunnen i flere dage, i nogle tilfælde over en uge.","The Lycosidae is the fourth largest spider family of the world encompassing ca 2320 species in 7 subfamilies and 107 genera.
They range in size from small to very large (2.8-45 mm body size). Most species are hunting spiders at ground level using no web for catching prey. However spiders of a few genera such as <i>Aulonia</i> and <i>Sosippus</i> make sheet webs provided with a funnel retreat, very similar to the webs of agelenid spiders. Spiders of some lycosid genera make burrows in the ground lined with silk serving as retreats and a place for the females to guard their egg sacks, e.g. species of <i>Alopecosa</i>, <i>Trochosa</i>, and <i>Arctosa</i>. Spiders of the <i>Pirata</i> genus make silk tubes in vegetation where they spend part of their time. Many other lycosids never use a retreat but are found running about in grass, leaf litter, over sandy or stony areas, across the surface of water and many other places. Wolf spiders are often very noticeable as many are active during daylight hours running about in sunshine hunting prey on the ground or in low vegetation. The females of some species <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pardosa_sordidata_female_JL5075_9888.JPG \"> attach the globular egg sack to the spinners</a>, which is then carried about. After the juvenile spiders emerge from the egg sack they will <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Alopecosa_fabrilis_hun_016.jpg \"> climb up on to the mothers abdomen</a> making it appear much larger. The spiderlings will stay well protected on the abdomen for several days or even weeks. Eventually they disperse and start a life on their own.","Øjnene sidder i tre rækker og er meget karakteristiske for familien. Forreste række består af fire små øjne i en ret eller svagt krummet række, anden række består af to meget store øjne, som altid sidder på det lodrette ansigt, og tredje række af to mellemstore øjne placeret i hver side af hovedet, som har mere eller mindre lodrette sider.","The lycosids belong to the group of araneomorph, ecribellate spider families having 8 eyes and 3 tarsal claws.

The anterior row has four small eyes set in a straight or slightly curved row, the second row has two large eyes further up on the on the vertical front, and the posterior row has two medium-sized eyes on the sides of the head which can be more or less steep sided. There are only few additional diagnostic characters of importance for the family, i.e. the lack of a retrolateral tibial apophysis on the male palp and that the female of many species carries her egg sack attached to the spinners. The carapace is longer than wide with the head region narrowed and high. It is usually densely covered with hairs and often with longitudinal median or lateral bands or both. In some genera there are characteristic bars in the median band or elongate U-, Y-shaped marks. The <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Alopecosa_inquilina_hun_1254.jpg\">sternum</a> is oval to shield shaped (scutiform).

Kort før ungerne forlader ægsækken, spinder hunnen sækken fast til nogle blade, og anlægger et ammespind omkring den. Her tilbringer ungerne deres første tid, mens hunnen vogter ammespindet. Efter andet hudskifte spredes ungerne.

However, they differ from the Lycosidae by having the size difference between the eyes smaller, and by having more elongate bodies with different markings. They are large spiders with long legs. The first two pairs often are held together at an angle when resting and when sensing prey. They do not use snares but hunt their prey actively in low vegetation or in ambush. The female spiders belonging to this family make large egg sacs, which is held by the chelicerae and palps beneath their body. When it is time for the spiderlings to emerge, the female fastens the egg sac to leaves or branches of small bushes, and spins a protective nursery web around it. The spiderlings stay in the nursery web until their second moult while the female stands guard over it. The family is represented with three species in two genera in North and Central Europe.",,

They range in size from medium to large (4.5 to at least 20 mm body size). Most species are living on sheet webs with a funnel or tubular retreat where the spider sits ready. When prey land on the web the spider rush out over it always in an upright position and grab the prey, which is then dragged back to the retreat for consumption. The web is usually built in low vegetation and bushes but some species inhabit the hollows of tree trunks, caves, and houses. Some indoor species are now almost cosmopolitan in distribution.","Familien består af meget behårede mellemstore til store edderkopper, som kendes på at de bagerste spindevortepar er toleddede og ofte meget lange. De lange spindevortepar ses tydeligt selv når edderkopperne ses oppefra, og er et godt kendetegn for familien. Arterne er også kendetegnet ved at tarserne har rækkestillede trichobotrier, der gradvis forøges i længde udadtil. Denne karakter deles dog med en del slægter, der i nyere tid er blevet flyttet over i andre familier.","The agelenids belong to the group of entelegyne, ecribellate spider families having 8 eyes and 3 tarsal claws. The members of the family are characterized by the often very long, two-segmented posterior spinnerets, which taper toward the tip. The long spinners are visible even when the spiders are viewed from above. Another character for the family is the tarsal trichobothria, which are arranged, in a single row and increases in length toward the distal end. However, this character is shared with species that have been transferred to other genera in recent times. The carapace is characterized by often having the head (cephalic region) narrow and very clearly separated from the wider thoracic region. The eyes are equal sized and arranged in 2 rows of 4. The curvature of the posterior row of eyes is characteristic for some of the commoner European genera with some having this eye row recurved, straight or procurved. Sternum is heart-shaped and sometimes with markings which may aid species identification. Labium is as wide as long. Many species have long slender spinose legs and are capable of fast runs. The abdomen is oval and tapering posteriorly usually with species-specific colour patterns dorsally in various shades of brown and grey. Both the carapace and the abdomen are often densely covered by plumose hairs but this is only visible when using a lens or stereomicroscope. Epigyne is often large but the differences between related species sometimes small and a stereomicroscope is therefore required for proper identification. The male palp has a tibial apophysis. The shape of the apophysis is sometimes visible with a lens facilitating reliable identification of live males. In this respect it is an advantage to confine the specimen in a glass tube."
28,"Hahniidae","Bertkau, 1878","Orgelpibeedderkopper","Lesser Cobweb Spiders",,"This is a fairly small, clearly defined family due to the peculiar arrangement of the spinners in a transverse row. The family is represented with ca. 235 species in 26 genera. They are found in most parts of the world but are missing in some arctic areas as well as being unrecorded from some smaller islands and archipelagos. The members of Hahniidae are small to medium sized spiders ranging from 1.3-6 mm body size. They are usually found close to the ground where they construct small sheet webs in low vegetation, amongst stones, and moss or across small depressions on the ground. The spider hunts on the upper side of the sheet and apparently uses no retreat.","Små edderkopper med rækkestillede forholdsvis lange spindevorter.","The members of Hahniidae belong to the group of entelegyne ecribellate spider families having 8 eyes and 3 tarsal claws. The eyes are equal-sized and arranged in 2 rows of 4 with both eye rows slightly procurved. The most important character for this family is the transversely arranged row of spinners being clearly visible with a lens. The outermost (posterior) pair of spinners is long and two-segmented. The carapace is longer than wide and narrowed in head region. Sometimes there are indistinct striae radiating from the short fovea and in front of this the head region often shows reticulations. The carapace is very glossy in many species due to lack of hairs except for some forward directed ones in the midline of the head region. Lateral side of chelicerae with stridulating ridges, these are more strongly developed in males. The labium is wider than long. The legs are short but nevertheless they are fast runners. There are few spines and the trichobothria are arranged in a row as in the Agelenidae in which family some genera of Hahniidae used to belong. The female palp is furnished with a claw, which is usually toothless. The abdomen is oval and often uniformly coloured in shades of brown with some lighter coloured species having clear chevrons while these are being more indistinct in darker species. The tracheal spiracle is situated one-third to halfway from the spinners to the epigastric fold. The epigyne is flat and small. Often curved ducts and spermathecae are visible and the overall impression is rather characteristic for the family despite great variation in the shape of epigynes between species. The male palp is furnished with both a patellar and a tibial apophysis and the shape of both are important characters when identifying species under the stereomicroscope."
29,"Mimetidae","Simon, 1881","Piratedderkopper","Pirate Spiders","Det danske navn piratedderkopper henfører til, at arterne i begge slægter hovedsageligt lever af at prædere på andre edderkopper, enten som lurejægere eller ved at invadere deres spind.

They spin no web but stalk or ambush their prey. Often the web of a potential prey spider is invaded. Sometimes the prey spider is lured to advance towards the pirate spider, which plucks the thread to imitate a lovesick male. The pirate spider then bites the prey spider, usually in a leg and then sucks it dry through the hole bitten. Pirate spiders are slow moving, perhaps an adaptation not to scare potential prey spiders in the vicinity or maybe to avoid triggering aggressive behaviour such as the pirate spider becomes the prey instead. The European members of the family are characterized by long legs, which often are clearly annulated.","Metatarsi I og II er udstyret med en prolateral række af lange torne, hvor der mellem de enkelte torne findes en række kortere torne, som krummer tydeligt mod spidsen.

They are extremely variable in shape and colouration with some species appearing fairly robust (for example <i>Steatoda</i>) while other delicate (for example thin-legged species such as <i>Ariamnes</i>). They range in size from very small to medium-sized (1-22 mm body size). I consider the fine whip spider <i>Ariamnes</i> (<i>Argyrodes</i>)<i> colubrinus</i> a medium-sized spider despite a body length of 22 mm because of the whip-like, extremely elongated abdomen. Most theridiid species build irregular three-dimensional space webs with criss cross threads. Some species use a retreat, usually placed inside the web. The spider often sits inverted in the web or hidden in the retreat but will run for cover or drop from the web if disturbed. They overpower their prey by wrapping it with sticky silk by activity of the hind legs. These are provided with a comb of serrated bristles, which draw silk from the spinners and fling it over the prey. Only when the prey is securely wrapped in silk does the spider approach to bite. The prey is consumed in the retreat or at the part of the web where the spider usually takes up its position if no retreat is used. The wrapping technique enable theridiids to overpower prey many times their own size. A few species have more or less abandoned web building and live as active hunters at ground level, for example <i> Steatoda phalerata</i>. Some males possess <a
href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Steatoda_nobilis_han_2171.jpg\">ridges </a> at rear of carapace opposed by teeth under the front end of the abdomen. Rapid movement of the abdomen while scraping the teeth against the ridges produce a sound, which is sometimes audible. The sound is used in courtship along with plucking and tapping the female web with palps and legs. The egg sacks are placed in the web or hidden inside the retreats and guarded by the female. Some females move the egg sacks to different positions during the day to optimize the climatic conditions.","Små til mellemstore edderkopper, mange almindelige arter med kuglerund, skinnende,  bagkrop og ofte smukke farvemønstre.

However, this comb is often difficult to discern in smaller species and males, even under the stereomicroscope. Other important diagnostic characters for the family include that the theridiids do not have the labium rebordered as opposed to the related families Araneidae, Linyphiidae, and Nesticidae. Also, they have few or no spines on their legs. Finally, the male palp is without a conspicuous paracymbium as in the Araneidae, Linyphiidae, Nesticidae, and Tetragnathidae. The carapace is very variable in shape among species, sometimes modified in males in to strange lobes not unlike those seen in the Linyphiidae. A few genera have rugose carapaces due to dense coverage of pits and warts, the latter sometimes hairy (for example <i>Crustulina</i> and <i>Steatoda</i>). In some species the carapace is almost circular and appears small relatively to the size of the abdomen. The clypeus is often very high. The sternum is triangular to shield-shaped (scutiform). It is domed in some species, for example in <i>Theonoe minutissima</i>. The eyes are sometimes subequal and sometimes of very different sizes. They are arranged in 2 rows of 4, the eyes of each row often equidistant. Lateral eyes are often situated close together or contiguous (for example <i>Pholcomma</i> and <i>Theonoe</i>). The secondary eyes are very often provided with a tapetum. The chelicerae are usually small and weak but some species with cheliceral apophyses may have long chelicers. Promargin with few teeth (0-3) while retromargin usually have none. The shape of endites is variable but usually they converge somewhat. The legs are moderately long to very long, lacking spines on femora, tibia, and metatarsus. The female palps possess a claw, which in the Hadrotarsinae subfamily is deeply clefted (palmate). The abdomen is very variable in shape from oval to round, sometimes globular or even higher than long. The abdomen sometimes extends over the posterior part of the carapace. In some species of the Argyrodinae subfamily the abdomen is extremely long and cylindrical. The colouration of the abdomen is also very variable as are the patterns. Some smaller species with unicoloured abdomens may resemble linyphiids. Species with sparsely haired abdomens often appear glossy. Colulus may be large and setose, small (represented just by the setae) or absent. The morphology of the colulus is often an important character in keys for theridiid genera. The tracheal spiracle is situated just in front of the spinners. Theridiids are entelegyne usually with well sclerotized epigynes. Tibia and patella of male palp are without apophyses. The palp does not have a paracymbium - just a hook on distal margin of cymbium serving as a locking device. The anterior edge of the male palpal tibia is often widened and provided with a row of long setae (e.g. in <i>Theridion</i>)."

Nesticiderne har også en relativ tæt og lang beklædning med børster på benene i forhold til kugleedderkopperne. Bentorne er fåtallige og afviger kun lidt fra benenes børster. Hos Nesticiderne er øjnene arrangeret i to rækker med hver fire øjne.","The spiders of the family Nesticidae are closely related to the Theridiidae (comb-footed spiders). Most specimens of both families have a comb of 6-10 serrated bristles on tarsus IV that are used to pull silk from the spinnerets. The Nesticids differ from the Theridiids by having a thickened edge on the anterior rim of the lower lip (rebordered labium), and by having longer legs, particularly the first pair. The legs are densely clothed with fairly long bristles, longer than in any theridiid. Leg spines are few, and differ only scarcely from the leg bristles. The eight eyes of the Nesticids are arranged in two rows of four."
32,"Theridiosomatidae","Simon, 1881","Dværghjulspindere","Ray Spiders","Lille familie hvoraf de fleste arter er tropiske, og er især udbredt i Sydamerika. Flere slægter i familien anlægger specielle hjulspind med kegleform. Eneste europæiske repræsentant fra familien er Theridiosoma gemmosum.","This is a small family of which almost all species are distributed in the tropics, with most species found in South America. Several theridiosomatid genera build orb webs distorted into a conical shape. <i>Theridiosoma gemmosum</i> is the only European representative of the family.","Øjnene er uens i størrelse. Begge øjenrækker er fremadbøjede, den forreste lidt og den bagerste meget. Familiens hunner mangler hjulspindernes og kugleedderkoppernes klo på palperne. Kæber uden udbulinger ved ydersiden af kæbernes basis (condyler) og uden et område med parallelle riller (stridulationsorgan), som ses hos mange tæppespindere (Linyphiidae). Familiens medlemmer er også karakteriseret ved, at besidde et relativt stort vedhæng (cololus) foran de forreste spindevorter. Colulus minder lidt om en lille spindevorte, og kan formodes at være afledt heraf tidligere i udviklingshistorien. Colulus findes kun hos et mindre antal familier, herunder også hos kugleedderkopperne (Theridiidae) og krabbeedderkopperne (Thomisidae). Størrelsen af colulus er i nogle tilfælde vigtig til at adskille familier og undertiden også slægter. Arterne i Theridiosomatidae mangler den kamformede række af børster på tarsus IV som ses hos de nærtstående kugleedderkopper.","Eyes heterogeneous. Both eyerows are procurved, the posterior row much more so than the anterior. The palps of female members of the family lack the claw, which set them apart from members of the families Araneidae and Theridiidae. The chelicers also lack a boss (condyles) laterally at their bases. This feature also separates the family from the Araneida in which the boss is prominent. The chelicers does not possess areas with parallel striae (stridulation organ) typical of most Linyphiid spiders. A relatively large appendage (colulus) is present in front of the anterior spinnerets. The colulus is probably derived from ancestral spinners and is functionless. A colulus is only present in a minority of families (e.g. the Theridiidae and Thomisidae) and its relative size is important, and used for identification to family and sometimes genus level. The members of the Theridiosomatidae do not have comb bristles on the dorsal side of tarsus IV that separates them from the Theridiidae in which some members have similar general appearance."
33,"Tetragnathidae","Menge, 1866","Stavedderkopper","Long-jawed Orb Weavers","De fleste medlemmer af familien er langstrakte og har givet familein det danske navn, stavedderkopper. Kaldes også hul-hjulspindere, idet familiens arter spinder hjulspind med hul i midten. Voksne edderkopper i <i>Pachygnatha</i> slægten afviger ved ikke at spinde fangnet.","The Tetragnathidae is the tenth largest spider family of the world encompassing almost 1000 species in 4 subfamilies and 51 genera. They range in size from small to large (2-23 mm body size). Many species build delicate sometimes more or less horizontal orb webs with an open hub and few, wide-set radii and spirals. The webs have no signal line and no retreat and are often found in vegetation near water. The spiders often sit in the centre of the web. If disturbed they drop to the ground or cling to the vegetation adopting a stretch position with the long legs stretched out rendering themselves inconspicuous. It should be noted that only immatures of the shorter-legged <i>Pachygnatha</i> genus build orb webs. Adults of this genus are free-living hunters seeking their prey in the vegetation or at ground level. The long and divergent chelicerae of many species are used to hold the female during mating. The egg sacks are placed on the ground, behind bark or fastened in the vegetation. Some species camouflage the egg sack so it looks like mould or a bird dropping (for example species of <i>Tetragnatha</i>). The egg sack is often guarded by the female who takes residence near the egg sack adopting the stretch position to camouflage herself against the background.",,"The tetragnathids belong to the group of ecribellate spider families having 8 eyes and 3 tarsal claws. Many members of the family are usually elongated spiders characterized by the often very long legs and chelicerae (subfamilies Tetragnathinae and Leucauginae). However there are some genera with oval abdomens or normal sized chelicerae (subfamily Metinae). Males are usually smaller and slimmer than females who often have the base of the abdomen swollen. Males often have relatively longer chelicerae than females and sometimes they are even longer than the carapace. The male chelicerae are also often furnished with spurs on their chelicerae, which are used to lock the female chelicerae during mating. The female palp is provided with a well-developed, toothed claw. The eyes are not unlike those of the araneids. They are subequal and arranged in 2 rows of 4 usually equidistant or with the medial eyes closer to each other than to the lateral eyes. The lateral eyes are either spaced apart or contiguous, sometimes situated on a tubercle. The primary eyes are always black. The secondary eyes of most genera are provided with a light-reflecting layer (tapetum) aiding nocturnal vision. However, tapetum is missing in a few genera such as <i>Tetragnatha</i> having all eyes black. The carapace is elongate and with short, shallow fovea (indistinct in <i>Tetragnatha</i>). The sternum is longer than wide and pointed at rear, sometimes protruding in between coxae IV. Narrow, horizontal sclerites are sometimes present between coxae and carapace. Endites are parallel and may either converge or dilate in front of the rebordered labium. The legs are long and slender and mostly with spines but in some genera there are none (for example <i>Pachygnathy</i>). The trichobothria are often branched. They are sometimes arranged in rows. The shape of the abdomen is variable sometimes round or oval but mostly elongate. Colours vary, quite often with bright white, green, red and yellow colours often with coppery or silvery blotches. Tetragnathids are entelegyne or secondary haplogyne (without epigyne). Sometimes the genital plate is not sclerotized (subfamily Tetragnathinae) and thus adult females may be difficult to separate from subadults and juveniles since there is no epigyne - just a hairy, tongue-shaped plate projecting posteriorly from the epigastric fold. The male palp is simple and often very similar within genera."

Tegningerne bagkroppen er meget karakteristiske for den enkelte art. Benene er korte og kraftige og med mange torne. Hannerne er ofte betydeligt mindre og slankere end hunnerne.","The Araneidae is the world’s third largest spider family with more than 2850 species described in more than 165 genera. They range in size from small to large (2-30 mm body size). The species occupy a wide range of habitats and are found in terrestrial ecosystems all over the world with the exception of some high arctic areas, islands and archipelagos. Most species build an orb web with sticky spiral threads but some genera in the tropics have reduced or abandoned web building altogether. The webs are built in the herb layer, in or between bushes and trees and on buildings and possibly in many other places. Some species stay in the hub of the web sometimes camouflaged by a stabilimentum. Other species use a retreat as a hiding place or stay outside the web, in both cases holding a signal thread to detect when prey become tangled in the web. When males become adult they leave their web in search of females. Great care is taken when approaching the female web so the usually larger female does not eat the male. I many species courtship is undertaken by plucking and jerking the female web to suppress predatory behaviour of the female and to have her express mating behaviour instead.",,"The araneids belong to the group of ecribellate spider families having 8 eyes and 3 tarsal claws. The eyes are arranged in 2 rows of 4 with the lateral eyes widely separated from the medial eyes. The carapace is often flat with a distinct head region. The chelicers are strong having a lateral condyle (boss at base of chelicer). Labium is wider than long and rebordered (swollen at anterior edge). Maxilla (basal part of palp used for chewing prey) are widest anteriorly. Legs with 3 claws and often furnished with strong spines and trichobothria on all segments except tarsi. Often legs are clearly annulated. The abdomen is usually globose and nearly always with species-specific often bright colour patterns. The abdomens of some species are round-shouldered while others have humps, the latter species often referred to as angulate orb weavers. Some tropical species have large outgrows on the abdomen. A colulus (midline appendage or tubercle) is present in front of the anterior spinnerets. The tracheal spiracle is situated close to spinnerets. Araneids belong to the entelegyne group of spiders often having large and complex epigynes sometimes with a large flexible scapus (finger-, tongue-, or lip-like projection arising in the midline of the epigyne). The male palp is complex."
35,"Linyphiidae","Blackwall, 1859","Tæppespindere","Line Weaving Spiders",,"The Linyphiidae is the worlds second largest spider family encompassing ca. 4320 species in more than 570 genera. The highest diversity is found in the northern temperate regions. In these regions as well as in the arctic regions spiders of this family dominates the spider fauna. The jumping spiders (Salticidae) is an even larger family but they generally require warmer conditions than the linyphiids and for this reason they are less well represented in the cooler regions. Linyphiids are found worldwide in all terrestrial biotopes and is perhaps the most widely distributed spider family. They range in size from very small to medium (1-8.5 mm body size). Most species are found at ground level but they occupy a very wide array of habitats. The members of the family build a sheet web sometimes dome shaped. The web has no retreat and the spider always hang inverted below the sheet. Larger species in particular sometimes add irregular vertical snares acting both as sheet suspension strands and barrage balloon wires impeding the flight of insects. When insects strike the vertical snares they fall down on the sheet and the spider rush to bite the prey through the sheet web. Many species disperse by air and the phenomenon of ballooning is very noticeable in this family when very dense populations try to balloon at the same time. The spiders climb up high in the vegetation and point the spinners toward the sky. In this position they let out some strands of silk and eventually the wind will lift the spiders up in the air. Often they only manage to fly a short distance but they will keep trying sometimes resulting in a layer of shimmering silk covering the vegetation. Ballooning takes place usually in late summer. Ballooning may result in spiders literally raining from the sky. <i>Erigone atra</i> is a very common aeronaut in late summer in some areas and on several occasions I have experienced specimens landing in my hair at short intervals, for example while I was sitting in my garden.",,"The linyphiids belong to the group of ecribellate spider families having 8 eyes and 3 tarsal claws. The eyes are arranged in 2 rows of 4, usually heterogeneous in size with the anterior medials smaller than the rest. Frequently, the eyes are ringed with black, this being most noticeable in species with lighter coloured carapaces such as many species of the Linyphiinae subfamily. Some species adapted to dark habitats have the eyes much reduced, sometimes being very minute in size or only evidenced by pale markings under the integument (e.g. <i>Porrhomma rosenhauri</i>). The carapace is highly variable especially in the smaller species belonging to the Erigoninae subfamily. Males of this large subfamily frequently have the frontal region modified into strangely formed lobes or bear other types of protuberances some of which may have tufts of hairs. Some species have the carapace punctured with pits (see images of <i>Lophomma punctatum</i>). The males may also have sulci (grooves) running backwards from the posterior eyes. The chelicerae do not possess a lateral condyle (boss at base of chelicer). The outer side of the chelicerae have horizontal stridulating ridges visible in many species. Such ridges only occur scattered in other spider families (see for example images of ridges in <i >Metellina stridulans</i> of the Tetragnathidae). The labium is strongly rebordered as in the Nesticidae, Araneidae, and Tetragnathidae. The endites are usually parallel. Legs are slender and provided with spines. The number of spines on the legs is an important character for species identification when this is undertaken using the stereomicroscope. The abdomen is nearly always longer than wide sometimes with a pattern (Linyphiinae in particular) and sometimes mainly uniformly coloured, very often blackish (Erigoninae in particular). Some species posses an abdominal scutum as for example some members of the <i>Ceratinella</i> genus. The epigynes are variable, sometimes simple as in the Erigoninae or provided with a scapus as often seen in the Linyphiinae. The male palp often possesses an U-shaped paracymbium. The family was earlier divided in to two subfamilies, which sometimes were elevated to family status: the Linyphiidae and Erigonidae (also known as Micryphantidae). The Linyphiidae was characterized by not having tibial apophyses on the male palp, by having a claw on the female palp in most species, and by having two dorsal spines on tibia IV or if only one spine present there was one short spine on metatarsi I and II. The Erigonidae was characterized by having at least one tibial apophyses on the male palp, by lacking a claw on the female palp, and by having just a single dorsal spine on tibia IV and with the metatarsi spineless, or all spines lacking altogether. However, the family is now divided in to seven subfamilies, the Dubiaraneinae, Erigoninae, Ipainae, Linyphiinae, Micronetinae, Mynogleninae, and Stemonyphantinae.

41,"Philodromidae","Thorell, 1870","Løbekrabbeedderkopper","Running Crab Spiders",,"The Philodromidae is a medium sized spider family comprising a world fauna of about 522 species in 29 genera. They range in size from small to large (2-16 mm body size). Philodromids have agile flattened bodies and laterigrade legs, which in most genera are of about the same lengths and thickness. They move rapidly around as their claw tufts and scopulae provide good adhesion to slippery surfaces. Species of <i>Philodromus</i> are able to move from one side of a leaf to the other or halfway round a stem so quickly that human eyes hardly manage to follow the motion. Once they stop running they instantly adopt a motionless, camouflaged posture with the legs stretched to closely follow the contour of the substrate. The laterigrade legs allow them to slip in to bark crevices etc. without raising the leg joints almost as they are 2-dimensional creatures. Many species are cryptic coloured and blend in with the substrate being very difficult to spot. Most species inhabit the foliage, branches, and stems of bushes and trees but many are also found running about at ground level, e.g. species of <i>Thanatus</i>. Species of <i>Tibellus</i> are elongated and adapted to a life on grass stems. Many species of <i>Philodromus</i> are capable of changing the depth of colour to conform to different backgrounds. <i>Philodromus margaritatus</i> occurs in two colour forms one of which is mottled in grey and brown perfectly camouflaged on bark. The second colour form <i>Philodromus margaritatus forma laevipes</i> is lighter with dark blotches and perfectly camouflaged on lichen covered stems. Most species in the northern temperate regions hibernate as subadults becoming adult in spring. The female constructs a woolly egg sack across a leaf, under bark etc. and some species stands guard directly over it while other species sit nearby.","Løbekrabbeedderkopperne hårbørster ved kløerne består af hår der er tykkest over midten (spatulate hår), og har hæftehår (scopulae) på tarsi I og II.

The eyes are not situated on tubercles. In many species they are fairly equal in size, however in some species all eyes of the anterior row or just the anterior medials are larger. The eyes are arranged in <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Thanatus_arcticus_submale_JL4997_9367.JPG\">two recurved rows</a> of four with the posterior row sometimes more strongly recurved than the anterior row. All legs are of about the same lengths or legs II alone longer (twice as long in <i>Ebo</i>). The legs are laterigrade so that the morphologically dorsal surface is rotated about one quarter of a turn to a posterior position. Tarsi I and II are provided with scopulae and claw tufts composed of spatulate hairs (thickest point on the distal half). The anterior tibia are sometimes provided with a <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Philodromus_emarginatus_juv_914.jpg\">row of long spines</a>. Other diagnostics characters which separate philodromids from the related thomisids and sparassids include the lack of a colulus and the absence of tapetum in the secondary eyes. The carapace is as long as wide or elongate, rather flattened usually with fovea absent. It is densely clothed in <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Philodromus_histrio_subfemale_JL5209_13568.JPG\">recumbent plumiform</a> or <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Philodromus_fallax_female_JL4238_4918.JPG\">spatulate</a> hairs.

The cheliceral fang furrow usually has no teeth. The labium is longer than wide. Endites are longer than labium and converge in front. The female palp has a small toothed claw. The shape of the abdomen is oval, in some species slightly longer than wide, in others quite elongate. In most species the widest point of the abdomen is found in the rear half. It is densely covered with recumbent hairs and sparsely covered with longer, erect hairs. The <a href=\"http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Thanatus_arcticus_submale_JL4997_9369.JPG\">cardiac mark</a> is darker than the surrounding abdomen, sometimes very distinctive as in e.g. <i>Thanatus</i>. It may be followed by a series of chevrons. The spinners are simple. The tracheal spiracle is situated close to the spinners. The epigyne is usually small having a median septum. The male palp is furnished with a tibial apophysis; the shape of which is important when identifying to species level using the stereomicroscope."
