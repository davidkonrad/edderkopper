They are found in most parts of the world with the exception of some arctic areas and islands such as Greenland and the Azorean Islands. Small to large spiders ranging 3-16 mm body size (Jocqué & Dippenaar-Schoeman 2007). Most European species are fairly large and robust, with relatively short and stout legs. Many species are ground dwellers constructing small funnel or tubular webs of cribellate or ecribellate silk under objects on the ground sometimes with a collar of silk spun around the opening. Some members of the <i>Amaurobius</i> genus constructs bluish cribellate webs behind bark of trees or on buildings and fences.","","","","This is a fairly small, poorly defined family, which is represented with ca. 680 species in 71 genera.

Amaurobiids possess three tarsal claws and are entelegyne. The 8 eyes are usually pale and arranged in 2 rows of 4. The carapace is longer than wide, often having a broad, only slightly elevated head region. A fairly distinct, longitudinal fovea is present in many species. The sternum is oval to shield-shaped and blunt apex at rear. The lateral edges of the sternum are often sinuous. The chelicerae are often strong and usually longer and more slender in males than in females. The labium is formed like a rounded square or rectangle. The endites are almost parallel with brushes of hairs (scopulae) anteriorly. The abdomen is usually dominated by shades of brown or grey, often very dark and with markings as more or less distinct chevrons. It is densely covered by fine hairs of varying size. The legs are moderately long, especially in males and mostly uniformly coloured but sometimes with dark annulations. The tarsi and metatarsi are furnished with trichobothria arranged in rows, females with calamistrum on metatarsus IV having two rows of bristles. A more or less strongly divided cribellum is present anterior to the spinners. The cribellum is, however, reduced in males. The epigyne is often formed as a central plate separated from lateral parts by sutures. The male palp has simple sclerotized tibial apophyses and the shapes of these are important for species identification.","","","5","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","4","0"

Sidstnævnte slægt er knyttet til myretuers indre, og individer træffes kun sjældent i den omkringliggende førn. Bortset fra disse to slægter indeholder familien små cribellate edderkopper, som anlægger små, uregelmæssige krustråsspind i toppen af urter og buske, i førn, under sten og på træstammer. Spindet er ikke klæbrigt som hos de fleste andre edderkopper, men består af mange krøllede tråde, som fastholder byttedyr ved hjælp af velcro virkning.","The dictynids are characterized by having 3 tarsal claws. They are cribellate but in many species the cribellum is reduced. They possess 8 eyes, however there are some 6-eyed <i>Cicurina</i> species in which the anterior medials are reduced. Some blind, cave dwelling <i>Cicurina</i> species even have they eyes reduced to zero. The calamistrum if present is arranged in one row (uniseriate). The cribellum is usually wide in those species possessing cribellum, bipartite or entire (absent in Cicurininae). The cephalic region of the Dictyninae is usually high perhaps to fit the relatively large poison glands. In this subfamily the cephalic region is furnished with longitudinal rows of white hairs. These are not present in the Tricholathysinae in which the carapace is pear-shaped. The sternum is triangular. The chelicerae are long and modified in males of some genera, e.g. <i>Dictyna</i>. The males of this genera has the chelicerae concave in front and bowed outward near the middle, often having a well developed mastidion (denticle or tubercle) on the anterior face of the chelicerae. The endites are converging. Legs are moderately long and usually without spines. In some genera tarsus of each leg are without a trichobothrium (e.g. <i>Dictyna</i>) while tarsus of each leg has one trichobothrium in others (e.g. <i>Lathys</i>). In <i>Cicurina</i>, tarsus of each leg possesses a series of trichobothria, which increase in length towards the distal end as in some genera of the Agelenidae family. In yet other dictynid genera there are two tarsal series of trichobothria. The abdomen is oval to elongate, often overhanging the carapace and densely covered with fine hairs, which sometimes are distributed to form a pattern. The cardiac mark is clear in some genera as in <i>Dictyna</i> but indistinct or absent in others as in <i>Cicurina</i>. Dictynids are entelegyne with the epigyne weakly sclerotized in some genera (e.g. <i>Dictyna</i> and <i>Argenna</i>) while more sclerotized in other genera (e.g. <i>Cicurina</i>). The male palp has a tibial apophysis. The embolus is long and slender in most species.","","","10","1","1","0","1","1","0","0","28","0"

Thus it is a complex organ which earlier on caused people working with spider systematics to believe that <i>Uroctea</i> and <i>Oecobius</i> were distantly related taxa.

Specimens have been found in a greenhouse on Vágoy, in a warehouse in Tórshavn and in a few houses.","","","","","The uloborids are entelegyne, cribellate spiders having four or eight eyes and three tarsal claws. They eyes are arranged in two rows of four in the subfamilies Hyptiotinae and Uloborinae. In Miagrammopinae the anterior row is reduced leaving just one row of four. The fourth subfamily, Tangaroinae, has mixed arrangement of the eyes since this subfamily is defined by other characters than carapace morphology. The eyes of <i>Hyptiotes</i> are very peculiar since they are placed rather far back on the carapace. The posterior row is situated about midway on the carapace and the laterals are placed on tubercles. The anterior row is also well removed from the front of the head. Uloborids are also characterized by a dorsally compressed, curved metatarsus IV possessing a uniseriate calamistrum (often absent in males). Additionally diagnostic characters include rows of long trichobothria on femora and the absence of poison glands. The carapace form is very different among the subfamilies and varies from long and narrow (Miagrammopinae) to ovoid (Uloborinae) and triangular (Hyptiotinae). The carapace is clothed with plumose hairs except in the Uloborinae. The sternum is divided in Miagrammopinae but undivided in other subfamilies. The shape is variable, some long, some oval, and some roughly triangular. The chelicerae do not possess a lateral condyle or poison glands. The fang furrows are provided with a cluster of small teeth or with fewer larger teeth. The shape of the labium is also very different among the subfamilies. In Hyptiotinae and Uloborinae it is semicircular but longer in Miagrammopinae. Many species have legs I and IV the longest with legs II only slightly shorter than legs IV. In Uloborinae tibia I is provided with a brush of long hairs. The female palp is provided with a dentate claw. The abdomen may have one or more pairs of humps (four pairs in <i>Hyptiotes cavatus</i>). Usually the colours and body shape provide excellent camouflage but there are some exceptions, for example <i>Uloborus walckenaerius</i> is easily spotted in the field. The anal tubercle is large and two-segmented. The anterior spinners are three-segmented. An undivided cribellum is present in front of the spinners with the exception of some males. The tracheal spiracle is situated in front of the cribellum. The epigyne is with paired projections (e.g. <i>Uloborus</i>) or unpaired (e.g. <i>Hyptiotes</i>).

They range in size from very small to medium-sized (1-10 mm body size), usually with long legs that may exceed 60 mm in some species. The species occupy a wide range of habitats and are found all over the world except for some islands and arctic regions. In recent decades synanthropic species in particular have gradually increased their range in the cooler, temperate regions. <i>Pholcus phalangioides</i> serves as an example and is now almost cosmopolitan in distribution. This species inhabit houses in most parts of the world and since it is independent of the climate outdoors it will probably continue to increase its range given there are heated buildings to occupy and enough prey to feed on during the cold season. Other synanthropic species that have increased their range in Europe include <i>Crossopriza lyoni </i> and <i>Holocnemus pluchei</i>. Perhaps global warming has influenced the spread, which mainly have taken place in recent years. Also the species <i>Pholcus opilionoides</i> occurring in natural and semi-natural habitats has increased its range northwards in Europe. Pholcids build three-dimensional messy, irregular, tangled webs in which they hang inverted on the under surface of the web. The webs are often constructed in dark and damp niches such as buildings and cellars, in caves, behind loose bark, in cavities between boulders, under rocks and other objects on the ground and in burrows. The web has no viscid properties but the criss-cross structure delay the escape of insects entangled in the web. The spider quickly advance to wrap its prey in silk and when securely wrapped the spider is able to inflict the fatal bite without any risk. Some species feed on other spiders even of their own kin. In my house I have observed <i>Pholcus phalangioides</i> to prey on spiders of its own species and large, stout species such as <i>Amaurobius similis</i> and <i>Scotophaeus blackwalli</i>. The species is also known to prey on other common house spiders of the northern temperate regions such as species of <i>Tegenaria</i>. I once interrupted the capture of a <i>Salticus scenius</i> female before the fatal bite. The salticid was completely wrapped in silk but nevertheless able to bite its way out and escape still going strong. If food is scarce some pholcids will leave their web and invade the webs of other spiders with the purpose of eating the host, the eggs, or the prey. They vibrate the web to mimic the struggle of trapped prey as an attempt to lure the host of the web to approach, unaware of it will be attacked. This is very much similar to the technique used by the pirate spiders (Mimetidae). When a pholcid is threatened the spider will spin itself in small circles so rapidly that the contours of the spider becomes blurred or almost invisible. This behaviour is possibly an effort to minimize the chance of it falling prey to predators passing by. If the spider continues to feel threatened it may drop from the web and walk away in an unsteady, wobbling fashion. Despite the clumsy pace it is nevertheless able to climb vertical surfaces.

Pholcids build three-dimensional messy, irregular, tangled webs in which they hang inverted on the under surface of the web. The webs are often constructed in dark and damp niches such as buildings and cellars, in caves, behind loose bark, in cavities between boulders, under rocks and other objects on the ground and in burrows. The web has no viscid properties but the criss-cross structure delay the escape of insects entangled in the web. The spider quickly advance to wrap its prey in silk and when securely wrapped the spider is able to inflict the fatal bite without any risk. Some species feed on other spiders even of their own kin. In my house I have observed <i>Pholcus phalangioides</i> to prey on spiders of its own species and large, stout species such as <i>Amaurobius similis</i> and <i>Scotophaeus blackwalli</i>. The species is also known to prey on other common house spiders of the northern temperate regions such as species of <i>Tegenaria</i>. I once interrupted the capture of a <i>Salticus scenius</i> female before the fatal bite. The salticid was completely wrapped in silk but nevertheless able to bite its way out and escape still going strong. If food is scarce some pholcids will leave their web and invade the webs of other spiders with the purpose of eating the host, the eggs, or the prey. They vibrate the web to mimic the struggle of trapped prey as an attempt to lure the host of the web to approach, unaware of it will be attacked. This is very much similar to the technique used by the pirate spiders (Mimetidae). When a pholcid is threatened the spider will spin itself in small circles so rapidly that the contours of the spider becomes blurred or almost invisible. This behaviour is possibly an effort to minimize the chance of it falling prey to predators passing by. If the spider continues to feel threatened it may drop from the web and walk away in an unsteady, wobbling fashion. Despite the clumsy pace it is nevertheless able to climb vertical surfaces. After the mating the female sits inverted in her web <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Crossopriza_lyoni_hun_1326.jpg">carrying her eggs in her chelicerae</a>. The eggs are loosely held together by a few strands of silk. The male will often <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Crossopriza_lyoni_han_og_hun_1527.jpg">stay nearby the female</a> until he dies. Females often live for more years than males and may mate again with another male. After hatching the spiderlings are either carried by the female for a few days where after <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pholcus_phalangioides_hun_med_unger_569.jpg">they stay in the web</a> guarded by the female. Eventually they will disperse to start a life on their own.The three northern European genera are easily separated by the shape and colour of their abdomens which is long and tubular in <i>Pholcus</i> and <i>Holocnemus</i> but globular in <i>Psilochorus</i>. The two former genera are distinguished by the colour of the ventral side of their abdomens which is light in the two <i>Pholcus</i> species, but black in <i>Holocnemus pluchei</i>. There is just one introduced Azorean species, <i> Pholcus phalangioides</i> which cannot be mistaken for any other species on the islands.","De forreste mediære øjne er de mindste, og de øvrige seks er placeret i to triader på en tilnærmelsesvis rund forkrop. Benene er meget lange og tynde med tarsi noget bøjelige.","The pholcids belong to the group of araneomorph, ecribellate spider families having 6 or 8 eyes and 3 tarsal claws. The anterior medials are smallest or absent in six-eyed species. The secondary eyes are arranged in two <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pholcus_phalangioides_han_JL4381_D3400.JPG">triads</a>, which in some species are placed on tubercles. Other diagnostic characters for the family include the high, often concave <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pholcus_phalangioides_hun_1280.jpg">clypeus</a> of about the same height as the chelicerae and the usually very long <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pholcus_opilionoides_female_JL4834_7509.JPG">legs</a> with long and flexible tarsi with many pseudosegments. The carapace is <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pholcus_phalangioides_hun_1282.jpg">subcircular</a> with the head region often raised. In some species fovea is well developed. The <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pholcus_phalangioides_han_JL4381_D3404.JPG">sternum</a> is convex often with sinuous sides, broadly truncated at rear. The chelicers are relatively weak and fused along the greater part of length. Males often have the chelicerae armed with teeth-like outgrowths. The labium is wider than long and fused with sternum. The female palp is small, slender and is not provided with a claw or tooth. The shape of the abdomen varies from globose to elongated cylindrical. The most common colours of the abdomen range between pale grey and darker brownish-grey. <i>Psilochorus simoni</i> has a bluish-green or blue abdomen. In some species a <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pholcus_phalangioides_hun_JL4381_D3344.JPG">cardiac mark</a> is clearly visible while in others this mark is just faintly darker than the ground colour of the abdomen. Many species also possess darker chevrons, bandings or blotches mainly in the midline of the abdomen. The abdomen of <i>Holocnemus pluchei</i> is <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Holocnemis_pluchei_juv_1539.jpg">reticulated</a> very much like a giraffe. In some genera the <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Psilochorus_simoni_juv_JL4361_3622.jpg">spinners</a> are situated ventrally and moved forward to a position near the epigastric furrow. There is no tracheal spiracle. Despite being haplogyne, pholcids do have the internal female genitalia protected by an epigyne like sclerotization. These are rather variable and allow pholcids to be identified from drawings of epigynes with the same ease as entelegyne spiders. The <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Pholcus_phalangioides_han_1274.jpg">male palp</a> is very complex having swollen palp segments and a large paracymbium.","","The current subdivision of the family in 5 subfamilies is outdated.","2","1","0","1","0","1","0","0","38","0"

The carapace is ovoid and rather low being smoothly convex and with a distinct fovea in most species. The head is not sharply set off from the thoracic region. Gnaphosids are fairly easily recognized by their cylindrical and parallel spinners, the anterior pair being slightly longer, and more heavily sclerotized than the posterior pair. The anterior spinners are separated from each other by approximately one spinner diameter with some exceptions, e.g. <i>Micaria</i> in which genus anterior spinners are closer. They have 8 eyes in 2 rows. The posterior medial eyes are often not round, but oval, triangular or reduced to slits. All eyes are with a silvery sheen except for the anterior medials, which are dark. The sternum is ovoid, pointed posteriorly. The chelicerae are robust, and the fang furrows are provided with teeth. The retromargin may have a sclerotized lamina (flat, keel-like plate) in place of teeth. This lamina is serrated in some genera. The curvature of the posterior row of eyes and the position and shape of cheliceral lamina and teeth are important characters when keying gnaphosids to genus level under the stereomicroscope. The endites usually have an oblique or transverse depression. They are provided with a serrula (row or cluster of tiny teeth on the front margin). Gnaphosids are also characterized by having 2 tarsal claws, claw tufts, and scopulae. Legs are stout and in some species there are small brushes of more and less stiff hairs present distally on metatarsus IV. Female palp is furnished with small spines and a finely toothed claw. The abdomen is often provided with dense coverage of short sleek hairs giving the abdomen a mousy-like appearance. Sometimes erect, curved setae are present, particularly at the anterior edge (see for example images of <i>Gnaphosa lucifuga</i>). Many species are uniformly coloured in greyish-brown or blackish colours. However, abdomens of some species have striking white patterns of spots or lines while abdomens of others are iridescent. Most males have a scutum at the anterior end. The spiracle is situated close to the spinners. Gnaphosids are entelegyne spiders often having rather large epigynes with sclerotized structures. They are somewhat variable and closely related species may be difficult to identify. Male palps are usually provided with a large tibial apophysis and the shape of this is important when identifying the species.","","","33","1","0","1","1","1","0","0","40","0"

The body is carried close to the substratum on moderately long, strong legs with normal prograde orientation. The legs are provided with two tarsal claws with dense claw tufts and scopulae giving good adhesion to slippery surfaces such as leaves. The tibia and metatarsi have one, two, or more pairs of spines ventrally. Some species have legs I the longest while other species legs IV. The abdomen is oval often tapering towards the spinners. Males sometimes have a small scutum. The abdomen usually uniformly coloured except for darker cardiac mark. Sometimes there are darker markings such as a median line or chevrons in the same colours as the cardiac mark. The anterior spinners of the clubionids are conical and contiguous and all three pairs form a compact cluster. The spiracle is situated close to the spinners. Clubionids are entelegyne spiders having the genital groove with its openings to the internal genitalia covered by a well-sclerotized plate (epigastric scutum), which also bears the paired copulatory openings. The spermathecae are often visible through the integument. The male palp has a retrolateral tibial apophysis.

Females are frequently seen <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Xysticus_ulmi_female_JL4980_9164.JPG">guarding their eggsack</a>. The family is represented with two species in Greenland, both belonging to <i>Xysticus</i>. Apparently, the species have divided the country between them with no overlap in distribution. <i>Xysticus deichmanni</i> is known from northeast Greenland while <i>Xysticus durus</i> is known from south and southwest Greenland.","The Thomisidae is the sixth largest spider family of the world encompassing ca 2062 species in 7 subfamilies and 171 genera.They range in size from small to large (2-23 mm body size). Thomisids have sturdy, moderately depressed bodies and strong, laterigrade legs with legs I and II longer than III and IV in most subfamilies. They move around in a characteristic crab-like fashion being capable of walking sideways as well as forwards and backwards. There is a great diversity in colours and forms. Some more brightly coloured species are active during the day. They occupy blossoms or other parts of vegetation where they ambush prey, often pollinators much larger than themselves. Some species are even capable of changing colour over a period of hours to several days to match the colour of the flower petals in which they reside. Other ground and bark living species have markings in grey and brown giving excellent camouflage in these surroundings. Some <i>Ozyptila</i> species are <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Ozyptila_scabricula_subfemale_JL5014_7355.JPG">covered by dirt</a> making them very difficult to spot on the ground. They make no prey-catching webs and spin no retreats for moulting, oviposition, or wintering. The first two pairs of legs are used for grabbing the prey when it inattentively have become within grasp. Legs III and IV are provided with scopulae and help to anchor the spider to the substrate during the short struggle with the prey. Once bitten the prey dies within seconds due to the high potency of thomisid venom. Often there is a great disparity in size and colouration between males and females, the males usually being much smaller and darker than the females.

Forkrop og bagkrop er brede og affladigede. Det første og andet benpar er tydeligt længere og kraftigere end de to bagerste, og benstillingen er laterigrad, dvs. drejet fremad så leddene bøjer i plan med kroppen. Bevægelserne er langsomme, og ofte sidelæns, hvilket giver en krabbelignende gangart. De fleste arter har to laterale bånd på forkroppen, som undertiden når helt ud til kanten. De midterste øjne er de mindste, de laterale sidder på små udvækster (tubercler), og de bagerste laterale vender i en retning skråt bagud. Bagkroppen er typisk bredest bagtil. Chelicererne er små, tilpasset til hurtig aflivning af byttedyr ved bid i hoved eller nakke.","The thomisids belong to the group of araneomorph, ecribellate spider families having 8 eyes and 2 tarsal claws. <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Xysticus_kochi_male_JL4730_5479.JPG">The eyes</a> are arranged in two recurved rows of four with the posterior row usually more curved than the anterior row. The median eyes are the smallest, the laterals on confluent tubercles, with the posterior laterals facing somewhat backwards. The secondary eyes are provided with tapetum. Thomisids belong to a morphologically very diverse family of spiders generally characterized by broad, moderately flattened carapace and abdomen. The carapace is about as long as wide being semicircular, ovoid or slightly elongated sometimes with protuberances. Usually, it is thinly covered by a few erect simple or clavate setae sometimes arising from warts. Most species have lateral bands on the carapace; sometimes the bands reach the edge. The sternum is heart-shaped. Chelicerae are relatively small and weak, adapted for quick kills by biting prey in the head. Cheliceral teeth are absent except in one subfamily. Sometimes there are small teeth (denticles) present on promargin. Endites and labium are frequently longer than wide. Legs I and II are longer and sturdier than legs III and IV. Legs articulate in plane of the body (laterigrade legs). The anterior legs are often provided with series of strong spines on tibia and metatarsi (e.g. <i>Xysticus</i> and <i>Ozyptila</i>). The abdomen is variable in shape and colour. It may be round, ovoid or elongate, nearly always widest at rear half. It is often covered by scattered <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Heriaeus_graminicola_female_JL4920_7857.JPG ">simple setae</a> or <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Ozyptila_scabricula_female_JL5014_10353.JPG">clavate hairs</a>. Abdominal colours vary from bright hues of white, yellow, green, and pink to shades of grey and brown in obscure patterns. The anterior spinners are short and conical and situated close together. A colulus is present in front of the spinners. The tracheal spiracle is situated close to the spinners. The epigyne is small and weakly sclerotized in some species. The epigynes of <i>Xysticus</i> species can be highly variable in depth of sclerotization within the same species and females are therefore sometimes difficult to identify by examination of epigynes. The tibia of the male palp is provided with ventral and retrolateral apophyses. Embolus is often long and curved along the rim of the cymbium.","","","20","1","0","1","1","1","0","0","30","0"

Both the carapace and the abdomen are often densely covered by plumose hairs but this is only visible when using a lens or stereomicroscope. Epigyne is often large but the differences between related species sometimes small and a stereomicroscope is therefore required for proper identification. The male palp has a tibial apophysis. The shape of the apophysis is sometimes visible with a lens facilitating reliable identification of live males.

The eyes are equal-sized and arranged in 2 rows of 4 with both eye rows slightly procurved. The most important character for this family is the transversely arranged row of spinners being clearly visible with a lens. The outermost (posterior) pair of spinners is long and two-segmented. The carapace is longer than wide and narrowed in head region. Sometimes there are indistinct striae radiating from the short fovea and in front of this the head region often shows reticulations. The carapace is very glossy in many species due to lack of hairs except for some forward directed ones in the midline of the head region. Lateral side of chelicerae with stridulating ridges, these are more strongly developed in males. The labium is wider than long. The legs are short but nevertheless they are fast runners. There are few spines and the trichobothria are arranged in a row as in the Agelenidae in which family some genera of Hahniidae used to belong. The female palp is furnished with a claw, which is usually toothless. The abdomen is oval and often uniformly coloured in shades of brown with some lighter coloured species having clear chevrons while these are being more indistinct in darker species. The tracheal spiracle is situated one-third to halfway from the spinners to the epigastric fold. The epigyne is flat and small. Often curved ducts and spermathecae are visible and the overall impression is rather characteristic for the family despite great variation in the shape of epigynes between species. The male palp is furnished with both a patellar and a tibial apophysis and the shape of both are important characters when identifying species under the stereomicroscope.","","","5","1","0","1","1","0","0","0","43","0"

Sometimes the prey spider is lured to advance towards the pirate spider, which plucks the thread to imitate a lovesick male. The pirate spider then bites the prey spider, usually in a leg and then sucks it dry through the hole bitten. Pirate spiders are slow moving, perhaps an adaptation not to scare potential prey spiders in the vicinity or maybe to avoid triggering aggressive behaviour such as the pirate spider becomes the prey instead. The European members of the family are characterized by long legs, which often are clearly annulated.","","","","","","","","Metatarsi I og II er udstyret med en prolateral række af lange torne, hvor der mellem de enkelte torne findes en række kortere torne, som krummer tydeligt mod spidsen.

They are often referred to as comb-footed spiders because tarsus IV of most species possess a row of slightly curved serrated bristles. This <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Steatoda_nobilis_female_JL4570_4283.JPG">comb</a> is visible with a lens in larger species. However, this comb is often difficult to discern in smaller species and males, even under the stereomicroscope. Other important diagnostic characters for the family include that the theridiids do not have the labium rebordered as opposed to the related families Araneidae, Linyphiidae, and Nesticidae. Also, they have few or no spines on their legs. Finally, the male palp is without a conspicuous paracymbium as in the Araneidae, Linyphiidae, Nesticidae, and Tetragnathidae. The carapace is very variable in shape among species, sometimes modified in males in to strange lobes not unlike those seen in the Linyphiidae. A few genera have rugose carapaces due to dense coverage of pits and warts, the latter sometimes hairy (for example <i>Crustulina</i> and <i>Steatoda</i>). In some species the carapace is almost circular and appears small relatively to the size of the abdomen. The clypeus is often very high. The sternum is triangular to shield-shaped (scutiform). It is domed in some species, for example in <i>Theonoe minutissima</i>. The eyes are sometimes subequal and sometimes of very different sizes. They are arranged in 2 rows of 4, the eyes of each row often equidistant. Lateral eyes are often situated close together or contiguous (for example <i>Pholcomma</i> and <i>Theonoe</i>). The secondary eyes are very often provided with a tapetum. The chelicerae are usually small and weak but some species with cheliceral apophyses may have long chelicers. Promargin with few teeth (0-3) while retromargin usually have none. The shape of endites is variable but usually they converge somewhat. The legs are moderately long to very long, lacking spines on femora, tibia, and metatarsus. The female palps possess a claw, which in the Hadrotarsinae subfamily is deeply clefted (palmate). The abdomen is very variable in shape from oval to round, sometimes globular or even higher than long. The abdomen sometimes extends over the posterior part of the carapace. In some species of the Argyrodinae subfamily the abdomen is extremely long and cylindrical. The colouration of the abdomen is also very variable as are the patterns. Some smaller species with unicoloured abdomens may resemble linyphiids. Species with sparsely haired abdomens often appear glossy. Colulus may be large and setose, small (represented just by the setae) or absent. The morphology of the colulus is often an important character in keys for theridiid genera. The tracheal spiracle is situated just in front of the spinners. Theridiids are entelegyne usually with well sclerotized epigynes. Tibia and patella of male palp are without apophyses. The palp does not have a paracymbium - just a hook on distal margin of cymbium serving as a locking device. The anterior edge of the male palpal tibia is often widened and provided with a row of long setae (e.g. in <i>Theridion</i>).","","","40","1","0","1","1","1","0","0","24","0"

Males often have relatively longer chelicerae than females and sometimes they are even longer than the carapace. The male chelicerae are also often furnished with spurs on their chelicerae, which are used to lock the female chelicerae during mating. The female palp is provided with a well-developed, toothed claw. The eyes are not unlike those of the araneids. They are subequal and arranged in 2 rows of 4 usually equidistant or with the medial eyes closer to each other than to the lateral eyes. The lateral eyes are either spaced apart or contiguous, sometimes situated on a tubercle. The primary eyes are always black. The secondary eyes of most genera are provided with a light-reflecting layer (tapetum) aiding nocturnal vision. However, tapetum is missing in a few genera such as <i>Tetragnatha</i> having all eyes black. The carapace is elongate and with short, shallow fovea (indistinct in <i>Tetragnatha</i>). The sternum is longer than wide and pointed at rear, sometimes protruding in between coxae IV. Narrow, horizontal sclerites are sometimes present between coxae and carapace. Endites are parallel and may either converge or dilate in front of the rebordered labium. The legs are long and slender and mostly with spines but in some genera there are none (for example <i>Pachygnathy</i>). The trichobothria are often branched. They are sometimes arranged in rows. The shape of the abdomen is variable sometimes round or oval but mostly elongate. Colours vary, quite often with bright white, green, red and yellow colours often with coppery or silvery blotches. Tetragnathids are entelegyne or secondary haplogyne (without epigyne). Sometimes the genital plate is not sclerotized (subfamily Tetragnathinae) and thus adult females may be difficult to separate from subadults and juveniles since there is no epigyne - just a hairy, tongue-shaped plate projecting posteriorly from the epigastric fold. The male palp is simple and often very similar within genera.","","The genus Nephila (golden silk orb-weavers) has been separated into its own family, Nephilidae.","14","1","0","1","1","1","0","0","21","0"

The four species are rather variable in colour markings but nevertheless fairly easily identified to species. In the field orb web may be very noticeable especially when covered by dew. The web of the water orb weaver <i>Tetragnatha extensa</i>, which co-occur with all Greenlandic orb weaver species could at first glance be mistaken for an orb web. However, the orb web of <i>Tetragnatha extensa</i> differ by having a hole in the centre. Also, <i>Tetragnatha extensa</i> differ from the Greenlandic orb weavers by its elongate abdomen and by nearly always residing in the web unless when it drops to the ground due to disturbance.","The Araneidae is the world’s third largest spider family with more than 2850 species described in more than 165 genera.

The eyes are arranged in 2 rows of 4 with the lateral eyes widely separated from the medial eyes. The carapace is often flat with a distinct head region. The chelicers are strong having a lateral condyle (boss at base of chelicer). Labium is wider than long and rebordered (swollen at anterior edge). Maxilla (basal part of palp used for chewing prey) are widest anteriorly. Legs with 3 claws and often furnished with strong spines and trichobothria on all segments except tarsi. Often legs are clearly annulated. The abdomen is usually globose and nearly always with species-specific often bright colour patterns. The abdomens of some species are round-shouldered while others have humps, the latter species often referred to as angulate orb weavers. Some tropical species have large outgrows on the abdomen. A colulus (midline appendage or tubercle) is present in front of the anterior spinnerets. The tracheal spiracle is situated close to spinnerets. Araneids belong to the entelegyne group of spiders often having large and complex epigynes sometimes with a large flexible scapus (finger-, tongue-, or lip-like projection arising in the midline of the epigyne).

The highest diversity is found in the northern temperate regions. In these regions as well as in the arctic regions spiders of this family dominates the spider fauna. The jumping spiders (Salticidae) is an even larger family but they generally require warmer conditions than the linyphiids and for this reason they are less well represented in the cooler regions. Linyphiids are found worldwide in all terrestrial biotopes and is perhaps the most widely distributed spider family. They range in size from very small to medium (1-8.5 mm body size). Most species are found at ground level but they occupy a very wide array of habitats. The members of the family build a sheet web sometimes dome shaped. The web has no retreat and the spider always hang inverted below the sheet. Larger species in particular sometimes add irregular vertical snares acting both as sheet suspension strands and barrage balloon wires impeding the flight of insects. When insects strike the vertical snares they fall down on the sheet and the spider rush to bite the prey through the sheet web. Many species disperse by air and the phenomenon of ballooning is very noticeable in this family when very dense populations try to balloon at the same time. The spiders climb up high in the vegetation and point the spinners toward the sky. In this position they let out some strands of silk and eventually the wind will lift the spiders up in the air. Often they only manage to fly a short distance but they will keep trying sometimes resulting in a layer of shimmering silk covering the vegetation. Ballooning takes place usually in late summer. Ballooning may result in spiders literally raining from the sky. <i>Erigone atra</i> is a very common aeronaut in late summer in some areas and on several occasions I have experienced specimens landing in my hair at short intervals, for example while I was sitting in my garden.","","","","The Linyphiidae is the worlds second largest spider family encompassing ca. 4320 species in more than 570 genera.

The eyes are arranged in 2 rows of 4, usually heterogeneous in size with the anterior medials smaller than the rest. Frequently, the eyes are ringed with black, this being most noticeable in species with lighter coloured carapaces such as many species of the Linyphiinae subfamily. Some species adapted to dark habitats have the eyes much reduced, sometimes being very minute in size or only evidenced by pale markings under the integument (e.g. <i>Porrhomma rosenhauri</i>). The carapace is highly variable especially in the smaller species belonging to the Erigoninae subfamily. Males of this large subfamily frequently have the frontal region modified into strangely formed lobes or bear other types of protuberances some of which may have tufts of hairs. Some species have the carapace punctured with pits (see images of <i>Lophomma punctatum</i>). The males may also have sulci (grooves) running backwards from the posterior eyes. The chelicerae do not possess a lateral condyle (boss at base of chelicer). The outer side of the chelicerae have horizontal stridulating ridges visible in many species. Such ridges only occur scattered in other spider families (see for example images of ridges in <i >Metellina stridulans</i> of the Tetragnathidae). The labium is strongly rebordered as in the Nesticidae, Araneidae, and Tetragnathidae. The endites are usually parallel. Legs are slender and provided with spines. The number of spines on the legs is an important character for species identification when this is undertaken using the stereomicroscope. The abdomen is nearly always longer than wide sometimes with a pattern (Linyphiinae in particular) and sometimes mainly uniformly coloured, very often blackish (Erigoninae in particular). Some species posses an abdominal scutum as for example some members of the <i>Ceratinella</i> genus. The epigynes are variable, sometimes simple as in the Erigoninae or provided with a scapus as often seen in the Linyphiinae. The male palp often possesses an U-shaped paracymbium. The family was earlier divided in to two subfamilies, which sometimes were elevated to family status: the Linyphiidae and Erigonidae (also known as Micryphantidae). The Linyphiidae was characterized by not having tibial apophyses on the male palp, by having a claw on the female palp in most species, and by having two dorsal spines on tibia IV or if only one spine present there was one short spine on metatarsi I and II. The Erigonidae was characterized by having at least one tibial apophyses on the male palp, by lacking a claw on the female palp, and by having just a single dorsal spine on tibia IV and with the metatarsi spineless, or all spines lacking altogether. However, the family is now divided in to seven subfamilies, the Dubiaraneinae, Erigoninae, Ipainae, Linyphiinae, Micronetinae, Mynogleninae, and Stemonyphantinae.

The eyes are not situated on tubercles. In many species they are fairly equal in size, however in some species all eyes of the anterior row or just the anterior medials are larger. The eyes are arranged in <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Thanatus_arcticus_submale_JL4997_9367.JPG">two recurved rows</a> of four with the posterior row sometimes more strongly recurved than the anterior row. All legs are of about the same lengths or legs II alone longer (twice as long in <i>Ebo</i>). The legs are laterigrade so that the morphologically dorsal surface is rotated about one quarter of a turn to a posterior position. Tarsi I and II are provided with scopulae and claw tufts composed of spatulate hairs (thickest point on the distal half). The anterior tibia are sometimes provided with a <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Philodromus_emarginatus_juv_914.jpg">row of long spines</a>. Other diagnostics characters which separate philodromids from the related thomisids and sparassids include the lack of a colulus and the absence of tapetum in the secondary eyes. The carapace is as long as wide or elongate, rather flattened usually with fovea absent. It is densely clothed in <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Philodromus_histrio_subfemale_JL5209_13568.JPG">recumbent plumiform</a> or <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Philodromus_fallax_female_JL4238_4918.JPG">spatulate</a> hairs.

The <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Philodromus_margaritatus_juv_206.jpg">sternum</a> is oval corresponding with carapace form, apex blunt between coxa IV. The cheliceral fang furrow usually has no teeth. The labium is longer than wide. Endites are longer than labium and converge in front. The female palp has a small toothed claw. The shape of the abdomen is oval, in some species slightly longer than wide, in others quite elongate. In most species the widest point of the abdomen is found in the rear half. It is densely covered with recumbent hairs and sparsely covered with longer, erect hairs. The <a href="http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/images/Pictures/Thanatus_arcticus_submale_JL4997_9369.JPG">cardiac mark</a> is darker than the surrounding abdomen, sometimes very distinctive as in e.g. <i>Thanatus</i>. It may be followed by a series of chevrons. The spinners are simple. The tracheal spiracle is situated close to the spinners. The epigyne is usually small having a median septum. The male palp is furnished with a tibial apophysis; the shape of which is important when identifying to species level using the stereomicroscope.","Denne familie betragtes af mange som en underfamilie af krabbeedderkopperne, Thomisidae.

","","","","","","","","","Body length range from 1-2.5 mm. Tergites undivided. Cephalothorax with parallel sides or wider in front than at rear. Carapace with two pairs of eyes near lateral edge, and close to anterior margin, some species have eyes reduced and possess only one pair or lack eyes altogether. Chelicers large. Hand and fingers slender compared to species of most other pseudoscorpion families. Hand wide at basis and without a stalk. Legs I and II are 6-segmented (one-segmented tarsi), the much stronger legs III and IV are 7-segmented (two-segmented tarsi). Body and legs with simple setae. Femur 1 (basifemur) of leg IV is considerably shorter than Femur 2 (telofemur). An intercoxal tubercle is present in Northern and Central European genera, but is lacking in several Southern European genera. Intercoxal tubercles are only found in the Chthoniidae. It is a small remnant of a sternal plate between the coxae of legs III and IV. It carries two setae. The family is represented in Northern and Central Europe with two genera, which are separated by the number of coxae with special coxal setae "Coxaldornen" (Beier 1963). These differs morphologically from the normal, simple body setae. <i>Mundochthonius </i> possesses coxaldornen only on coxae II while <i>Chthonius</i> on both coxae II and III.","","","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0"
"47","106","Larcidae","Harvey, 1992","1","1","","Larcid Pseudoscorpions","","","","","","","","","","","Harvey (1992) performed a cladistic analysis of the Pseudoscorpionida and revised the classification. He judged that two genera of the Garypidae were sufficiently different, and they were transferred to the newly erected Larcidae. This family is characterized by having the anal plate surrounded by a desclerotized region, and by having a row of setae along posterior margin of sternites III and IV (Harvey 1992). Larcidae is represented by one genus, <i>Larca</i>, in Europe with six species. <i>Larca lata</i>, is rather rare but widespread in Northern and Central Europe. <i>Larca bosselaersi</i> is known from a cave in Crete, Greece. <i>Larca fortunata</i>, <i>L. hispanica</i>, and <i>L. lucentina</i> are known from Spain. <i>Larca italica</i> is known from an Italian cave.","","","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0"
"48","102","Neobisiidae","Chamberlin, 1930","4","37","","Neobisiid Pseudoscorpions","","Species of the Neobisiidae are widely distributed in Europe. The best known pseudoscorpion in northern Europe, <i>Neobisium carcinoides</i>, is frequent in a wide array of habitats. It is probably the pseudoscorpion with the most northernly distribution, and is the sole species found in natural habitats in Iceland and the Faroe islands.","","","","","","","","","Body length range from 1.0-6.0 mm (Beier 1963). Tergites undivided. Cephalothorax without transverse grooves, rectangular or roughly square. Carapace with one or two pairs of eyes, a few cave-dwelling species have none. A small, more or less triangular process on the front margin of the carapace (epistome) is present in most species. Chelicers large, about half the length of the carapace. Pedipalps smooth or partly granulate. Only fixed finger with poison apparatus. Teeth of pedipalpal fingers closely set and uniformly sized. All tarsi two-segmented. Femora of leg I and II are 2-segmented and articulate, femoral segments of leg III and IV are not freely mobile, a vertical line indicates where the joints have become fixed (symphysis). The family is represented in Northern and Central Europe with four genera, which are separated by the shape of galea, number of eyes, and position and number of trichobothria on the fixed pedipalpal finger. Using external characters to determine sex of specimens is difficult for members of this family. ","","","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0"
